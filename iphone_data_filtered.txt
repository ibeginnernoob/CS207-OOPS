List of iPhone models

The iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus are smartphones developed and marketed by Apple. They are the eighteenth-generation iPhones, succeeding the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus, and those phones succeed the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus. The devices were unveiled alongside the higher-priced iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max during the September 9, 2024 Apple Event at Apple Park in Cupertino, California.[3] These lower-end phones come with the software update iOS 18, with more updates to come later in the future.


History
--------------------------------------------------
When Apple announced in "It's Glowtime" Event, The SiP chip of the lower-priced iPhone 16 lineup have skipped from the Apple A17 Pro (used in the iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max and iPad Mini 7th generation) to the regular Apple A18 (a low-entry variant 5-core GPU successor to the Apple A16 Bionic used in the iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 14 Pro Max, iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus) which this SiP is the first Apple A-series SiP in the iPhone to come with the two variants including the low-entry Apple A18 (a 5-core GPU variant, used in the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus) and the high-end Apple A18 Pro (a 6-core GPU variant, used in the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max).

The devices were unveiled during an event on September 9, 2024, marking the first time an iPhone release had been announced on a Monday.[4] It is also the first iPhone to not come included with Apple stickers, as Apple removed it for "environmental reasons", but the stickers can be included if a customer asks for it at an Apple Store.[5]


Design
--------------------------------------------------
Like the iPhone 15, the device features rounded edges, a slightly curved display, and back glass.


Display
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus retain their screen sizes of 6.1 inches and 6.7 inches, respectively. They feature a full-edge screen design with slim borders.


Camera
--------------------------------------------------
iPhone 16 features a more refined dual-lens array on the back, with a 48 megapixel Fusion wide-angle lens and 12 megapixel ultra-wide lens. The cameras are now aligned vertically, similar to iPhone 12, instead of diagonally like on iPhone 15, enabling spatial video capture.

There is also an improved Photographic Styles feature for real-time lighting and color adjustments, allowing specific tones and colors to be manipulated. [6]


Colors
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 16 and 16 Plus come in five colors: ultramarine, teal, pink, white and black.[7]


Hardware
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 16 and the iPhone 16 Plus use an Apple A18 system on a chip. The chip is optimized for running Generative artificial intelligence and features a Neural Engine that is twice as fast as its predecessor.

The iPhone 16 includes an updated 48-megapixel Fusion camera, the same resolution as the iPhone 15, with 2 μm, quad pixel PDAF, sensor-shift OIS, 100% Focus Pixels, support for super-high-resolution photos (24MP and 48MP). It has a new ultrawide camera with a wider aperture, automatic focus and 1.4 μm, 100% Focus Pixels.[8]

All ‌iPhone 16‌ models have an improved thermal design. The main logic board has been updated, centralizing chip placement and optimizing the surrounding architecture. The recycled aluminum substructure dissipates heat for up to 30 percent higher sustained performance for gaming.[9]

Every model in the iPhone 16 lineup has support for WiFi 7.[10]


Action Button
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus come with the Action Button, first featured on the iPhone 15 Pro lineup. By default, the Action Button toggles silent mode. However, users can change the button's feature to do different things other than silent mode, like open the Camera app or toggle a focus mode.


Camera Control button
--------------------------------------------------
All iPhone 16 models now come with a new button called Camera Control. This button is on the right side of the device, and allows the user to open the camera app, switch between different camera controls and features, and taking photos and videos. The button can distinguish between light and hard presses. By pressing the button once, it opens the camera app. By lightly pressing it twice, it opens a small menu with different camera controls, such as zoom or tone. Pressing the button hard once takes a photo, while holding for a few seconds starts a video. [11]


Battery and charging
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 16 has been upgraded in terms of battery capacity.[12]

The base iPhone 16 has video playback duration of up to 22 hours, while the iPhone 16 Plus has video playback up to 27 hours. The iPhone 16 has duration of audio playback up to 80 hours, 20% less than the iPhone 16 Plus with 100 hours of audio playback. The MagSafe wireless charging standard has been refreshed with a longer cable as an option, allowing the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus to charge at a faster speed of 25W with a 30W power adapter.


Enclosure
--------------------------------------------------
The enclosure is made up of 85% recycled content.[8]


Software
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 16 launched with iOS 18. While the device was announced alongside Apple Intelligence, these features were delayed until after release.[13]

iOS 18 includes RecoveryOS on the iPhone 16 series that allows users to recover and restore firmware wirelessly using another iPhone.[14]


Specifications
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 16 and 16 Plus have a vertical camera layout, similar to the iPhone 12, as opposed to the diagonal layout for iPhone 13, iPhone 14, and iPhone 15. USB Type-C port is used, albeit with USB 2.0 data transfer speeds up to 480 Mb/s.[15]


Price
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 16 has a starting price of US$799, while the iPhone 16 Plus starts at US$899. Pre-orders began on September 13, 2024, and sales started September 20.[16]


Criticism
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 16 has received positive feedback for several aspects, but also shows a few limitations. The upgraded design is a favourite, bringing a refreshed aesthetic with the available vibrant colour options, which feel more dynamic than past models. The display maintains Apple’ Super Retina HDR quality, but is limited to a 60Hz refresh rate, which some users find outdated compared to faster displays on cheaper competitor phones.[17][18]

List of iPhone models

The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are smartphones developed and marketed by Apple. They are the seventeenth generation of iPhones, succeeding the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus. The devices were announced on September 12, 2023, during the Apple Event at Apple Park in Cupertino, California alongside the higher-priced iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max. Pre-orders began on September 15, 2023, and the devices were made available on September 22, 2023. Like the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, the 15 and 15 Plus are the first iPhones to replace the proprietary Lightning connector with USB-C to comply with European Union mandates.


History
--------------------------------------------------
In September 2021, the European Commission began considering a proposal to mandate USB-C on all devices in the European Union, including iPhones.[10] Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo claimed that Apple would drop its proprietary Lightning connector by 2023. At the time of those claims, Apple was considering switching to USB-C due to the likelihood that the EU proposal would pass.[11] The proposal was passed into law in October 2022, becoming the Radio Equipment Directive. Apple confirmed it would comply with the regulations later that month.[12]

Two weeks prior to the formal introduction of the iPhone 15, it was announced that some of the devices which were made in India would for the first time be sold around the world on the launch day.[13]


Design
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 15 is the first major redesign since the iPhone 12, featuring rounder edges and a slightly curved display, and back glass. Both models are available in five colors: blue, pink, yellow, green and black.[1] This makes it the first entry level iPhone since the iPhone XR to not ship with a Product Red variant at launch.


Hardware
--------------------------------------------------

Display
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 15 features a 6.1-inch (155 mm) display with Super Retina XDR OLED technology at a resolution of 2556×1179 pixels and a pixel density of about 460 PPI with a refresh rate of 60 Hz. The iPhone 15 Plus features a 6.7-inch (170 mm) display with the same technology at a resolution of 2796×1290 pixels and a pixel density of about 460 PPI. Both models have an improved typical brightness of up to 1,000 nits, a peak HDR brightness of up to 1,600 nits, and a peak outdoor brightness of up to 2,000 nits.[9] The Dynamic Island feature, previously exclusive to iPhone 14 Pro, is now standard on iPhone 15, replacing the notch that was introduced in the iPhone X.[14]


Charging and transfer speeds
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus use USB-C with USB 2.0 transfer speeds (up to 480 Mb/s or 60 MB/s),[15] compared to the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max which have faster USB 3.2 Gen 2 transfer speeds (up to 10 Gb/s or 1.25 GB/s).[16] The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus, as well as the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, are the first iPhone models to use USB-C, as well as the first iPhones since the iPhone 5 to switch to a new charging port.


Video output
--------------------------------------------------
All iPhone 15 models have support for DisplayPort Alternate Mode over USB-C video output with HDR up to 4K resolution.[9]

Previous iPhone models (from iPhone 5 until iPhone 14) had a maximum supported resolution of 1600 x 900 (slightly less than 1080p) with the Lightning Digital AV Adapter due to technical constraints of the Lightning connector.[17]


Battery
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 15 Plus offers users up to 26 hours of video playback and up to 100 hours of audio playback, and the iPhone 15 offers significantly less, with up to 20 hours of video playback and up to 80 hours of audio playback.[18]


Software
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus launched with iOS 17 and is compatible with iOS 18.[19][20][21] Consistent with the UK Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure regulation, it will continue to receive major software updates for a minimum of five years to at least 2028.[22]


Specifications
--------------------------------------------------
6.33 by 3.06 in (161 by 78 mm)

Criticism
--------------------------------------------------

Overheating
--------------------------------------------------
Some owners claimed that their iPhone 15s were experiencing overheating issues,[26] reportedly reaching temperatures as high as 47 °C (117 °F).[27] Apple later stated that there were several reasons why the phones heat up, mainly hinting at a software issue.[28] It was stated that it would be fixed with an update to iOS 17.0.3.[29] The overheating issues were reported to persist after the update.[30]

List of iPhone models

The iPhone 4 is a smartphone that was developed and marketed by Apple Inc. It is the fourth generation of the iPhone lineup, succeeding the iPhone 3GS and preceding the iPhone 4s. Following a number of notable leaks, the iPhone 4 was first unveiled on June 7, 2010, at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco,[7] and was released on June 24, 2010, in the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Japan.

The iPhone 4 introduced a new hardware design to the iPhone family, which Apple's CEO Steve Jobs touted as the thinnest smartphone in the world at the time; it consisted of a stainless steel frame which doubled as an antenna, with internal components situated between two panels of aluminosilicate glass.[8] The iPhone 4 introduced Apple's new high-resolution "Retina display" (with a pixel density of 326 pixels per inch), while maintaining the same physical size and aspect ratio as its precursors, Apple's A4 system-on-chip, along with iOS 4—which notably introduced multitasking functionality and app folders. It was the first iPhone at the time to include a front-facing camera, which made possible Apple's new FaceTime video chat service, and the first to be released in a version for CDMA networks, ending AT&T's period as the exclusive carrier of iPhone products in the United States.

The iPhone 4 received a largely positive reception, with critics praising its revamped design and more powerful hardware, in comparison to previous models. While it was a market success (with over 600,000 pre-orders within 24 hours), the release of the iPhone 4 was plagued by highly publicized reports concerning abnormalities in its new antenna design that caused the device to lose its cellular signal if held in a certain way. Most direct contact with the phone's outer edge would cause a significant decrease in signal strength. Apple released iOS 4.0.1 to try to fix these issues, but were unsuccessful.[9]

The iPhone 4 spent the longest time as Apple's flagship iPhone model at fifteen months. Although the succeeding 4S was announced in October 2011, the 4 continued to be sold as a midrange model until September 2012, and thereafter as the entry-level offering in Apple's lineup until September 2013 with the announcement of the iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c. The iPhone 4 had one of the longest lifespans of any iPhone ever produced, spanning close to four years and available in some developing countries until early 2015.


History
--------------------------------------------------

Prototypes
--------------------------------------------------
Before the official unveiling of the iPhone 4 on June 7, 2010, two prototypes were brought to the attention of the media, breaching Apple's normally secretive development process. Many of the speculations regarding technical specifications proved accurate.


Engadget leak
--------------------------------------------------
On January 27, 2010, gadget website Engadget received leaked images of the unreleased first-generation iPad.[10] Unbeknownst to the editors and readers, these images contained two unreleased iPhone 4 models.[11] It wasn't until the subsequent Gizmodo release that they were aware of the complete contents of the images.[12]


Gizmodo leak
--------------------------------------------------
On April 19, 2010, gadget website Gizmodo reported that they had purchased an iPhone prototype for $5000, and furthermore, had conducted a product teardown of the device. The prototype was reported to have been lost by an Apple employee, Gray Powell, in Redwood City, California.[13] Shortly after Gizmodo published detailed information about the prototype, Apple's legal associates formally requested for the phone to be returned to Apple, and Gizmodo responded with the intent to cooperate.[14]

On April 23, officers from the Rapid Enforcement Allied Computer Team (REACT) task force of the California HTTAP Program raided the home of Jason Chen, the Gizmodo editor responsible for reviewing the prototype, seizing all of his computers and hard drives.[15] The Electronic Frontier Foundation criticized the raid as violating journalist source protection laws that forbid the seizure of journalist computers, as well as the suspicion that Apple had used its influence as a member of the steering committee, which is charged with direction and oversight of the California REACT task force to push police into action in a way that would not normally be conducted for this type of incident. Apple had already received the iPhone prototype before the raid when it was returned by Gizmodo.[16] The District Attorney stated that the investigation was suspended, and discontinued searching through the Gizmodo editor's belongings as they determine whether the shield laws are applicable, and cautioned that no charges have been issued at this point.[17][18]


Taoviet leak
--------------------------------------------------
Pictures and video of a second prototype were published on a Vietnamese website, Taoviet, on May 12, 2010.[19] It was almost identical to the first, and used an A4 chip manufactured by Apple.[20] The website purchased the prototype for $4,000.[21] DigiTimes reported that the screen resolution of the new phone was 960-by-640, which was confirmed by Apple at the iPhone 4's official announcement.


Release
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 4 was available for pre-order on June 15, 2010.[22] Customers attempting to pre-order the iPhone 4 reported problems with the pre-order process on the US and UK online Apple Stores which crashed due to the surge in traffic.[23] The same issue was reported with AT&T and SoftBank, Apple's exclusive partners in the United States and Japan respectively, who suspended advance sales of the iPhone 4 as demand threatened to exceed supply.[24] Retail stores were also unable to complete pre-order transactions due to the servers crashing.[25]

Apple and its partner carriers received 600,000 pre-orders for the iPhone 4 in the first 24 hours, the largest number of pre-orders Apple had received in a single day for any device up to that point.[26] Engadget reported that at 20:30 UTC, all iPhone 4 pre-order suppliers had sold out.[27] 1.7 million iPhone 4 models were sold in its first three days of availability.[28]

The iPhone 4 was also released through Orange in Tunisia and was available in eight cities at the launch.[29] On July 30, 2010, iPhone 4 was made available for sale in Australia, New Zealand and 15 other countries with free bumper cases.[30][31] In South Korea, it was released by KT on September 10. In Israel, it was released, too, on September 24, through Cellcom, Pelephone and Orange. It was launched in Thailand on September 23 by AIS, DTAC and True Move, and in Malaysia on September 26 in Kuala Lumpur, and nationwide on September 27 according to the Malaysian service provider Maxis.

The iPhone 4 was released in South Africa on September 22 on the Vodacom and MTN networks, in very limited quantities.[32] The iPhone 4 was launched in Vietnam on September 30 on VinaPhone and Viettel, at first in three major cities: Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City and Da Nang, and then all over the country by the end of October.

The iPhone 4 was launched in India on May 27, 2011 by Aircel and Airtel.[33]

On January 11, 2011, Verizon Wireless announced during a media event that it had reached an agreement with Apple and would begin selling a CDMA iPhone 4 in the United States, ending Apple's exclusivity agreement with AT&T. The Verizon iPhone went on sale on February 10 and pre orders began on February 3.[34][35][36] The Verizon iPhone includes the 'Personal Hotspot" feature which allows a user to use the iPhone as a wireless hotspot, with up to five devices connecting at one time. The February 3, 2011, presale of the iPhone 4 broke Verizon's first day sales records for a single device.[37]

On June 24, 2010, Apple stated that the white iPhone 4 models were proving more "challenging to manufacture" than expected, and initially pushed the release date back to the second half of July.[38] There was a lot of speculation surrounding the delay of the white iPhone 4. Among the most popular rumours are those concerning the phone's internal camera being adversely affected by light leaking in due to the semi-translucent glass and the white paint.[39][40] Other sources report that the problem relates to Apple's inability to match the white colour of the front faceplate with that of the home button.[41] On April 27, 2011, Apple announced that it would be releasing the white iPhone 4 model on April 28, 2011, for both GSM and CDMA.[42] The release of the white iPhone 4 was carried out on April 28.[43][44]

During Apple's official unveiling of the iPhone 4s on October 4, 2011, it was announced that Sprint would begin carrying the CDMA iPhone 4 and the iPhone 4s in the US on October 14.[45][46]


Discontinuation
--------------------------------------------------
In September 2013, after the release of the iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c, Apple stopped selling the iPhone 4 in most of their stores as well as on their website. It was replaced by the 8 GB iPhone 4s.[47][48][49]

The display of the iPhone 4 was manufactured by LG under an exclusive contract with Apple. It features an LED backlit TFT LCD capacitive touchscreen with a pixel density of 326 pixels per inch (ppi) on a 3.5 in (8.9 cm) (diagonally measured), 960×640 display. Each pixel is 78 micrometers in width. The display has a contrast ratio of 800:1. The screen was marketed by Apple as the "Retina display", based on the assertion that a display of approximately 300 ppi at a distance of 305 millimetres (12 in) from one's eye, or 57 arcseconds per pixel,[50] is the maximum amount of detail that the human retina can perceive.[51] With the iPhone expected to be used at a distance of about 12 inches from the eyes, a higher resolution would allegedly have no effect on the image's apparent quality as the maximum potential of the human eye has already been met.

This claim was widely disputed. Raymond Soneira, president of DisplayMate Technologies, said in an interview with the Wired magazine, that his claims by Jobs are something of an exaggeration: "It is reasonably close to being a perfect display, but Steve pushed it a little too far". Soneira stated that the resolution of the human retina is higher than claimed by Apple, working out to 477 PPI at 12 inches (305 mm) from the eyes, or 36 arcseconds per pixel.[52]

However, Phil Plait, author of Bad Astronomy, whose career includes a collaboration with NASA regarding the camera on the Hubble Space Telescope, responded to the criticism by stating that "if you have [better than 20/20] eyesight, then at one foot away the iPhone 4's pixels are resolved. The picture will look pixellated. If you have average eyesight, the picture will look just fine".[53][54]


Camera
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 4 features an additional front-facing 640x480 camera, and a backside-illuminated 5 megapixel rear-facing camera with a 3.85 mm f/2.8 lens[55][1] and an LED flash. The rear-facing 5-megapixel camera is capable of recording HD video in 720p at 30 frames per second. Both cameras make use of the tap to focus feature, part of iOS 4, for photo and video recording.[56] The rear-facing camera has a 5× digital zoom.


Connectivity
--------------------------------------------------
In contrast to Steve Jobs' announcement at WWDC 2010, Federal Communications Commission documentation showed that, in fact, the iPhone 4 contains a penta-band 3G UMTS antenna, not a quad-band 3G UMTS radio, as advertised by Apple [citation needed]. According to the FCC documentation filed by Apple, the radio inside the iPhone 4 supports 800, 850, 900, 1,900, and 2,100 MHz. The 800 MHz frequency, which is most commonly used in Japanese mobile phones, is not advertised as being supported by Apple.[57] However, the 800 MHz band is a subset of the 850 MHz band, which probably explains why the device was advertised as quad-band.[citation needed] The chip-sets were manufactured by Skyworks Solutions[58] and Infineon for GSM version.

As with most of Apple's mobile products at the time, the iPhone 4 also used the 30 pin dock connector as its only external data port.

The iPhone 4 is the first generation of iPhone to have a second microphone used for noise cancellation. It is located on the top of the unit near the headphone jack; the main microphone is on the bottom left.[59]


Gyroscope and accelerometer
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 4 introduces a gyroscopic sensor that detects 3-axis angular acceleration around the X, Y, and Z axes, enabling precise calculation of yaw, pitch, and roll. The gyroscope complements the accelerometer, a sensor that has been present since the original iPhone, which detects the device's acceleration, shake, vibration shock, or fall by detecting linear acceleration along with one of three axes (X, Y, and Z). The combined data from the accelerometer and the gyroscope provides detailed and precise information about the device's 6-axis movement in space. The 3 axes of the gyroscope combined with the 3 axes of the accelerometer enable the device to recognize approximately how far, fast, and in which direction it has moved in space.[60]


Processor, memory and storage
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 4 is powered by the Apple A4 chip, which was designed by Intrinsity[61] and, like all prior iPhone models, manufactured by Samsung.[62] This system-on-a-chip is composed of an ARM Cortex-A8 CPU integrated with a PowerVR SGX535 GPU.[63] The Apple A4 was also used in the first-generation iPad (released in 2010), where it was clocked at its rated speed of 1 GHz. The Apple A4 was the first ever mobile phone processor designed by Apple. The clock speed in the iPhone 4 was never disclosed. All prior models of the iPhone had underclocked the CPU, which typically extends battery life and lowers heat dissipation.

The iPhone 4 has 512 MB of DRAM. The additional DRAM supports increased performance and multi-tasking.[64] As on prior models, all data is stored in flash memory, 8, 16 or 32 GB, and not on the SIM. Unlike prior generations, the storage capacity is not printed on the back of the unit.


Micro-SIM
--------------------------------------------------
The GSM iPhone 4 uses a micro-SIM card, which is positioned in an ejectable tray, located on the right side of the device. The CDMA iPhone 4, however, the phone connects to the network using an ESN. All prior models have used regular mini-SIM cards. Depending on the operator, micro-SIM cards may not be available for all networks globally. As a technical workaround, it is possible to trim a mini-SIM card with a knife or scissors so that it fits into the micro-SIM tray.[65]


Design
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 4 features a redesigned structure, designed by Jony Ive, a design that would later be reused and adapted for the iPhone 4S, 5, 5S and first-generation iPhone SE. Most notably, the bulges of the back panel as well as the band between the front and back are gone and have been replaced with flattened surfaces. The redesign reflects the utilitarianism and uniformity of existing Apple products, such as the iPad and the iMac. The overall dimensions of the iPhone 4 have been reduced from their predecessor.[66]

It is 115 millimetres (4.5 in) high, 58.6 millimetres (2.31 in) wide, and 9.4 millimetres (0.37 in) deep, compared to the iPhone 3GS, which is 116 millimetres (4.6 in) high, 62 millimetres (2.4 in) wide, and 12 millimetres (0.47 in) deep; making the iPhone 4 24% thinner than its predecessor, the iPhone 3GS. Steve Jobs claimed it to be "the thinnest smartphone on the planet."[66] The reduced size of the device is primarily due to the externally placed antenna.

The iPhone 4 is structured around a stainless steel frame that wraps around the edge of the phone, acting both as the primary structure for the device and as the iPhone 4's antennas. This metal band features two slits on the GSM version of the phone, one at the lower left, and one at the top (and a fake slit along the lower right, to cosmetically mirror the one at the lower left) that divide the band into two antenna sections: the left section of the band serves as the Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and GPS antenna, and the right and lower sections of the band act as the antenna for GSM and UMTS connectivity.

On the CDMA version of the phone, there are four slits in the metal band. Two at the top (on the left and right) and two at the bottom. This divides the metal band into four different segments, which like the GSM version of the phone, serve as different antennas for connectivity. The top portion of the band (divided by the top left and right slits) is for connecting to the CDMA network. The left portion of the metal band is for Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and GPS just like the GSM version. The right side is not an antenna but serves to cosmetically mirror the left side and also to create a similar look to the GSM version of the phone.

The internal components are situated between two panels of aluminosilicate glass, described by Apple as being "chemically strengthened to be 20 times stiffer and 30 times harder than plastic," theoretically allowing it to be more scratch-resistant and durable than the prior models.[8]

In fall 2010, pentalobe screws started to replace the Philips screws used in post-repair units in the US and in production units in Japan.[67]


Software
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 4 shipped with iOS 4, which was the newest version of Apple's iOS mobile operating system at the time. iOS 4 introduced a multitasking system, allowing apps to remain "suspended" in memory, perform certain operations in the background, and allowing users to switch between apps using an on-screen menu.[68] It also introduced FaceTime, which allows users to perform video calls between other iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, and Mac OS X users.

The iPhone 4 supports up to iOS 7, released in September 2013. Due to the relatively aged hardware of the iPhone 4, most features available on newer iPhone models are not available on the device; as of iOS 7, they include Siri, 3D maps and turn-by-turn navigation, AirDrop, AirPlay mirroring, live camera filters, panorama mode and certain visual effects introduced by iOS 7, such as the blurring of translucent interface elements, the parallax effect on the home screen, and live wallpapers.[69] While still subject to the same limitations, iOS 7.1 did bring some slight performance improvements to the operating system on the iPhone 4. iOS 7, specifically iOS 7.1.2, is the last version of iOS to support the iPhone 4. Unlike the iPhone 4s, the iPhone 4 did not receive the iOS 8 update due to performance issues.[70][71]


Accessories
--------------------------------------------------

Bumper
--------------------------------------------------
Apple released a plastic and rubber case called the Bumper to protect the edges of the phone. The case, which also provided some screen protection, included buttons and holes that enabled switch and connector access.[72]

Apple updated the bumper with a wider volume switch hole with the release of the iPhone 4 for CDMA networks. The updated bumper is also compatible with iPhone 4s, the next-generation iPhone that has the same exterior design and measurements as the CDMA model of the iPhone 4, but with a SIM card slot as well.


Reception
--------------------------------------------------

Pre-release
--------------------------------------------------
Pre-release reception was largely positive.[73] The announcement included information that had not been covered by Gizmodo. Fox News commented that "seeing it in action is far more informative than staring at Gizmodo's photos of a busted test unit".[74] Rhodri Marsden of The Independent said that "aside from the introduction of face-to-face video calling, it's not a staggering feature set," instead focusing on how the device is "more powerful than its predecessor, speedier, easier to use and will make previously laborious tasks seem like a cinch".[75]

CNET reacted to the announcement by explaining how it believes that iMovie for iOS was the "most exciting part of this year's WWDC Keynote". The article noted how the iPhone 4, unlike current cameras, can record HD content and then edit it from the same device, labeling it a "true mobile editing suite".[76]


Reviews
--------------------------------------------------
Reviews of the iPhone 4 were largely positive. Walt Mossberg of The Wall Street Journal called the device "the best device in its class".[77] Engadget named it the "best smartphone on the market" in June 2010.[78] CNET gave the iPhone 4 a rating of 8.6 out of 10, one of the highest ratings it had given any smartphone.[79] TechRadar gave the device 4.5/5 stars.[80] Consumer Reports said the signal problem was the reason they did not rate it a "recommended" model, although the other tests ranked it highest among smartphones.[81]

Joshua Topolsky of Engadget described the device's industrial design as being "more detailed and sophisticated" than its predecessor.[78]


Technical problems
--------------------------------------------------
Some users reported a yellow discoloration of the screen that disappeared after several days, which was attributed to the glass lamination glue that was used. It did not have time to dry fully before the unit reached consumers due to the speed of manufacturing.[82] Another issue reported by some users within days of the iPhone 4 release was that during calls the proximity sensor can be insensitive, so that facial contact with the touchscreen can end calls, mute calls, and dial other numbers.[83] Some users reported that, particularly in low-light conditions, photos taken on the iPhone 4 sometimes contained blue or green "splotches." Issues with white balance were also discovered, particularly when using the flash.[84][85]


Antenna
--------------------------------------------------
Shortly after the iPhone 4 was launched, some users reported that signal strength of the phone was reduced when touching the lower left edge of the phone, bridging one of the two locations which separates the two antennas, resulting in dropped calls in some areas with lower signal reception.[86][87][88] In response, Apple issued a statement advising that customers should "avoid gripping [the phone] in the lower left corner" when making or receiving a call.[89] Internally, senior antenna expert Ruben Caballero raised concerns to CEO Steve Jobs that the antenna design could lead to dropped calls.[90]

As a consequence of this problem, it was reported on July 2, 2010 that several iPhone 4 users were planning on suing Apple and AT&T for fraud by concealment, negligence, intentional misrepresentation and defective design. The legal challenge was started by a law firm, who set up a website to recruit disenchanted iPhone 4 buyers for a lawsuit against Apple.[91][92] Later that day, Apple issued another statement stating that it had discovered the cause of the "dramatic drop in bars".[93]

Apple explained how the formula it used to calculate the number of bars to display was "totally wrong". Apple promised to correct the issue and release a software update within a few weeks that would address the "mistake", which had been present since the original iPhone.[93] The New York Times commented that "the failure to detect this longstanding problem earlier is astonishing."[94]

Consumer Reports initially stated that the iPhone 4's signal issues are not "unique, and may not be serious" and it continued to mention that signal loss is a problem that is faced by the entire smartphone industry. It was such a problem that Apple made a formal apology onstage. The next day, the magazine altered their stance after encountering instances of dropped calls.[95] The magazine rejected Apple's explanation after conducting tests in a controlled environment, and comparing the results against prior generations of iPhone. It sarcastically pointed out that using a piece of tape to cover the lower left antenna gap was one way to fix the problem, but recommended that consumers who "want an iPhone that works well without a masking-tape fix" purchase the iPhone 3GS instead.[81] The magazine also tested the iPhone 4 while it was wearing a Bumper, a frame-like cover sold by Apple that prevents direct contact with the antenna, reporting that it did resolve the problem.[96] CNN repeated Consumer Reports' statement that a small amount of duct tape had proven an effective fix to the iPhone 4's dropped call issue.[97]

On July 16, 2010, at a press conference which included a private tour of Apple's antenna design lab for journalists,[98] Steve Jobs announced that Apple would provide all iPhone 4 owners with a free case to help solve the antenna issue and a refund to those users who had already purchased a Bumper. The free case offer would be valid until September 30, 2010, when Apple would re-evaluate the situation.[99][100] To get a free case, owners were able to apply via an app installed on the phone found in the App Store from July 22, 2010 to September 30, 2010. Jobs also announced that Apple could not produce enough Bumpers for all owners of the phone, but would source a supply and offer a range of cases.[101] Additionally, Jobs cited figures from AppleCare which showed that only 0.55 percent of all iPhone 4 users have complained to the company about the issue, while the number of phones returned to Apple was 1.7 percent – 4.3 percentage points less than the number of iPhone 3GS models that were returned in the first month of the phone's launch.[101]

Consumer Reports noted that the solution was not permanent, though a good first step.[102] However, because Jobs did not specify a time line for fixing the problem, and the offering for a free bumper only being a temporary solution, PC World decided to remove the iPhone 4 from its "Top 10 Cell Phones" chart and reassign it to a pending rating.[103]

Despite the negative media attention regarding the antenna issues, 72% of iPhone 4 users said that they were "very satisfied" with their iPhone 4 according to an August 2010 survey by ChangeWave Research.[104] The GSM iPhone 4 continued to be sold unchanged until its discontinuation in September 2013, while the CDMA iPhone 4 and all models of the iPhone 4S featured a tweaked antenna design to prevent the issue from happening.


iPhones in space
--------------------------------------------------
In 2011, two iPhone 4 units equipped with a special application were taken to the International Space Station aboard the Space Shuttle on the STS-135 mission.[105] The devices were used in various experiments, utilizing sensors and a special app.[105]

List of iPhone models

The iPhone 5 is a smartphone that was developed and marketed by Apple Inc. It is the 6th generation iPhone, succeeding the iPhone 4s, and preceding both the iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c. It was formally unveiled as part of a press event on September 12, 2012, and subsequently released on September 21, 2012. The iPhone 5 was the first iPhone to be announced in September, and setting a trend for subsequent iPhone releases, the first iPhone to be completely developed under the guidance of Tim Cook and the last iPhone to be overseen by Steve Jobs. The iPhone 5's design was used three times, first with the iPhone 5 itself in 2012, then with the iPhone 5s in 2013, and finally with the first-generation iPhone SE in 2016.

The iPhone 5 featured major design changes in comparison to its predecessor. These included an aluminum-based body which was thinner and lighter than previous models, a taller 4-inch screen with a nearly 16:9 aspect ratio, the Apple A6 system-on-chip, LTE support, and Lightning, a new compact dock connector which replaced the 30-pin design used by previous iPhone models. This was the second iPhone after the iPhone 4s to include Apple's new Sony-made 8 MP camera.

Apple began taking pre-orders on September 14, 2012, and over two million were received within 24 hours. Initial demand for the iPhone 5 exceeded the supply available at launch on September 21, 2012, and was described by Apple as "extraordinary", with pre-orders having sold twenty times faster than its predecessors. While reception to the iPhone 5 was generally positive, consumers and reviewers noted hardware issues, such as an unintended purple hue in photos taken, and the phone's coating being prone to chipping. Reception was also mixed over Apple's decision to switch to a different dock connector design, as the change affected iPhone 5's compatibility with accessories that were otherwise compatible with previous iterations of the line.

The iPhone 5 was officially discontinued by Apple on September 10, 2013, with the announcement of its successors, the iPhone 5s and the iPhone 5c. The iPhone 5 has the joint second-shortest lifespan of any iPhone ever produced with only twelve months in production, breaking with Apple's standard practice of selling an existing iPhone model at a reduced price upon the release of a new model. This was broken by the iPhone X which only had ten-months in production from November 2017 to September 2018, and tied with the iPhone XS which had twelve-months from September 2018 to September 2019.

It was replaced as a midrange and then an entry-level device by the iPhone 5c; the 5c internal hardware specifications are almost identical to the 5 albeit having a less expensive polycarbonate exterior shell. The iPhone 5 supports iOS 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10. The iPhone 5 does not support iOS 11 due to it dropping support for 32-bit devices. The iPhone 5 is the second iPhone to support five major versions of iOS after the iPhone 4s.


History
--------------------------------------------------
Rumors about the iPhone 5 began shortly after the announcement of the iPhone 4s, though detailed leaks did not emerge until June 2012.[12] On July 30, 2012, reports pinpointed the dates on which the iPhone 5 would be unveiled and released, along with some accurate predictions of its features.[13] On September 4, 2012, Apple announced they would be hosting an event at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco on September 12, 2012. A shadow of the numeral 5 was featured in the invitations sent to the media, suggesting that the next iPhone would be unveiled at the event.[14]

At the unveiling, Apple announced the iPhone 5 and also introduced new iPod Nano and iPod Touch models. They also stated that pre-orders would be accepted starting September 14, 2012.[1][15] Over two million pre-orders were received within 24 hours.[5][16] The iPhone 5 was made available for sale to the public on September 21, 2012.[17] Initial demand for the new phone exceeded the record set by its predecessor, the iPhone 4s, by selling over 5 million units in the first three days.[18] On November 30, 2012, Apple added an unlocked version of the iPhone 5 to their online US store, with the 16 GB model starting at US$649.[19][20]

The iPhone 5 was officially discontinued by Apple on September 10, 2013, with the announcement of its successors, the iPhone 5s and the iPhone 5c.[21] While the 5c shared almost the same internal hardware as the iPhone 5, the 5c used a lower-cost polycarbonate plastic case in place of the original 5's aluminum form. The introduction of the 5c deviated from Apple's previous market strategy, where the previous iPhone model would remain in production, but sold at a lower price point below the new model.[21]

On April 28, 2014, Apple initiated an out of warranty recall program to replace any failing power buttons of iPhone 5 models which were manufactured prior to March 2013 at no cost.[22] On August 23, 2014, Apple announced a program to replace batteries of iPhone 5 models that "may suddenly experience shorter battery life or need to be charged more frequently" which were sold between September 2012 and January 2013.[23][24]


Litigation
--------------------------------------------------
Following the release of the iPhone 5, Samsung announced that it was filing a lawsuit against Apple for infringing eight of its patents. The case was scheduled to begin in 2014.[25] In a statement, Samsung said it had "little choice but to take the steps necessary to protect our innovations and intellectual property rights".[26] Litigation between the two involving patent infringement has been ongoing and is being fought in several court cases around the world.[27]


Production
--------------------------------------------------
The components and labor required to construct the most basic iPhone 5 are estimated to cost US$207, which is US$19 more than the cost of components for the corresponding iPhone 4s model. The LTE module in the iPhone 5 alone costs $34, $10 more than the cellular module in the iPhone 4s. Similarly, screens used in the iPhone 5 cost $44, which is $7 more than the screen of its predecessor. Mashable noted that the profit margin of selling each device is "huge" as the iPhone 5 retails for US$649.[28][29]

After the announcement of the device, a lack of supply was evident. This was due to a shortage of components such as the screen. Reports emerged, stating that Sharp was unable to ship the screen before the debut of the iPhone 5, and other manufacturers reported that it was difficult to keep up with demand. As a result, the number of pre-orders rose due to the uncertainty of stock at retail stores, and the delivery dates for pre-orders were postponed to dates that were after the initial release date of the device.[30]


Quality control inspectors strike
--------------------------------------------------
China Labor Watch, a New York State–based NGO, reported that "three to four thousand" Foxconn workers who work at the iPhone 5 production plant in Zhengzhou stopped working on October 5, 2012.[31] The strikes occurred after Apple implemented a stricter quality standard on their products, which includes a 0.02 mm restriction on indentations inflicted during production, and imposed demands related to scratches on frames and back covers.[31] The strikes were also attributed to the employer forcing employees to work on a public holiday. The report stated training was inadequate for quality demands expected and led to employees producing products that did not meet standards. During the strike, conflicts between quality control inspectors and employees resulted in brawls. China Labor Watch also claimed that concerns raised by inspectors were not addressed by factory management.[31] Foxconn spokesmen admitted that a micromanagement problem exists, but also said that there were only 300 to 400 workers absent and the conflicts did not influence production processes.[32] In November 2012 Foxconn chairman Terry Gou reported that the delay in production was due to undisclosed difficulties in assembly.[33]


Features
--------------------------------------------------

Operating system and software
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 5 features iOS, Apple's mobile operating system.[34] The user interface of iOS is based on the concept of direct manipulation, using multi-touch gestures. Interface control elements consist of sliders, switches, and buttons.[35] Interaction with the OS includes gestures such as swipe, tap, pinch, and reverse pinch, all of which have specific definitions within the context of the iOS operating system and its multi-touch interface. Internal accelerometers are used by some applications to respond to shaking the device (one common result is the undo command) or rotating it vertically (one common result is switching from portrait to landscape mode).[35]

The iPhone 5 is shipped with iOS 6, which was released on September 19, 2012.[34] Many of the iPhone 5's features that work specifically with the included iOS 6.0 operating system only worked in certain territories on release.[36] Apple has said this is a rolling program, which will take longer to implement across more regions.[37]

The phone can act as a hotspot, sharing its internet connection over WiFi, Bluetooth, or USB,[38] and also accesses the App Store, an online application distribution platform for iOS developed and maintained by Apple. The service allows users to browse and download applications from the iTunes Store that were developed with Xcode and the iOS SDK and were published through Apple.

The iPhone 5 can play music, movies, television shows, ebooks, audiobooks, and podcasts and can sort its media library by songs, artists, albums, videos, playlists, genres, composers, podcasts, audiobooks, and compilations. Options are always presented alphabetically, except in playlists, which retain their order from iTunes.[39] Users can rotate their device horizontally to landscape mode to access Cover Flow. Like on iTunes, this feature shows the different album covers in a scroll-through photo library. Scrolling is achieved by swiping a finger across the screen. Alternatively, headset controls can be used to pause, play, skip, and repeat tracks. On the iPhone 5, the volume can be changed with the included Apple Earphones, and the Voice Control feature can be used to identify a track, play songs in a playlist or by a specific artist, or create a Genius playlist.[39]

Like the iPhone 4s, the iPhone 5 has Siri,[39] that allows the user to operate the iPhone by spoken commands. The software was improved in iOS 6 to include the ability to make restaurant reservations, launch apps, dictate Facebook or Twitter updates, retrieve movie reviews and detailed sports statistics.[40]

On the iPhone 5, texting can be aided by the voice assistant, which converts speech to text.[39] In addition to regular texting, messaging on the iPhone 5 supports iMessage, a specialized instant messaging program and service that allows unlimited texting to other Apple devices running iOS 5 or later. This supports the inclusion of content such as images and sound in text messages, integration with the device's voice-controlled software assistant, and read acknowledgments for sent messages. Input to the device comes from a keyboard displayed on the multi-touch screen or by voice-to-text by speaking into the microphone. Entered text is supported by predictive and suggestion software; there is a multi-language spell-checker which recognizes many regional accents of different languages.[39]

iOS 6 features several new and/or updated apps, which includes Apple Maps and Passbook. Apple's built-in Maps app, which replaced the former Maps app powered by Google Maps, had been universally derided and lacked many features present in competing maps apps.[41][42] It uses Apple's new vector-based engine that eliminates lag, making for smoother zooming. New to Maps is turn-by-turn navigation spoken directions, 3D views in some major cities and real-time traffic.[40][43] iOS 6 is able to retrieve documents such as boarding passes, admission tickets, coupons and loyalty cards through its new Passbook app. An iOS device with Passbook can be scanned under a reader to process a mobile payment at locations that have compatible hardware. The app has context-aware features such as notifications for relevant coupons when in the immediate vicinity of a given store.[40][44]

Facebook comes integrated through Apple's native apps with iOS 6. Facebook features can be directly accessed from within native apps such as Calendar which can sync Facebook events, or use Facebook's like button from within the Apple App Store.[40]

New privacy settings are available to the user. In addition to location services, the following have been added in iOS 6: photos (already partially restricted in iOS 5), contacts (address book), calendars, reminders, Bluetooth sharing, Twitter, Facebook, and Sina Weibo. iOS 6 also comes with a "Limit ad tracking" user control in the general settings menu to allow users the option to prevent targeted advertising. Apple's Advertising Identifier replaces the company's existing Unique Device Identification (UDID) standard. Advertising networks not yet using Apple's Advertising Identifier device identifier standard would not be affected, although Apple will require the standard in the future.[45]


Design
--------------------------------------------------
Apple emphasized the improved build quality of the iPhone 5 at its press event.[15] The frame used in previous versions was redesigned to use an aluminum composite frame.[46] The iPhone 4 and iPhone 4s used stainless steel instead of aluminium due to Steve Jobs' preference for the metal which he thought, "looks beautiful when it wears".[47]

The iPhone 5 is 18% thinner, 20% lighter, and has 12% less overall volume than its predecessor, the iPhone 4s.[48] The phone's aluminum body is 0.30 in (7.6 mm) thick. At the September 2012 conference Apple claimed it was the thinnest smartphone in the world at 7.6 mm, though that claim was disputed as the Chinese Oppo Finder was thinner and some other smartphones could be considered to be thinner, depending upon where thickness is measured. The Oppo Finder measured 6.65 mm (0.262 in) at its thinnest point and 7.1 mm (0.28 in) at its thickest point making it overall thinner than the iPhone.[49][50][51][52] This design was used three times, first with the iPhone 5 in 2012, then with the 5s in 2013, and finally with the first-generation iPhone SE in 2016.


Hardware
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 5 uses a system on chip (SoC), called the Apple A6.[17][53][54] The SoC comprises a 1.3 GHz dual-core processor, 1 GB of RAM and a tri-core PowerVR SGX543MP4 running at 266 MHz.[55][56] The iPhone 5's operating memory (LPDDR2-1066 eDRAM) was doubled, from 512 MB to 1 GB. Storage capacities available are fixed at 16, 32 or 64 GB, the same as the 4s; plug-in memory cards are not supported.[57] The two color options are black (with black glass and slate-colored metal trim), and white (with white ceramic and silver-colored metal trim); again the same color options (though differently implemented) as its predecessor the 4s had.[58] The iPhone 5 retains the 8 megapixel back camera on the iPhone 4s, but has improved low-light performance, and has a 40% faster photo capture[59] than its predecessors, while having a purple hue when a strong source of light is present in the photograph.[60] The front camera, which is accessible through the FaceTime and camera app has a lower resolution, at 1.2 megapixels. The rechargeable lithium-ion battery with a charge capacity of 1440mAh[9] is built in and cannot be replaced by the user; it is rated at ≤225 hours of standby time and ≤8 hours of talk time. There are three separate models of the phone available: one supporting CDMA and two GSM versions.[61][62] This can have knock-on effects for which version of the device will actually work in which countries/regions.[citation needed] The phone takes a nano-SIM, smaller than the micro-SIM of the iPhone 4 and iPhone 4s.[63]

Hardware benchmarking conducted using Geekbench and GLBenchmark validates several claims that Apple included on their website and mentioned at the unveiling of the device, these include two times faster and two times the graphics performance. In the Geekbench overall hardware assessment, the iPhone 5 received a score that was approximately 2.5 times higher than the iPhone 4s. The benchmark conducted using GLBenchmark for the iPhone 5 returned a score that was 2 times better than the iPhone 4s. The result was however inconsistent as a 3D graphics benchmark assessment using Passmark returned a score that was only approximately 1.45 times better than the iPhone 4s.[64][65] Battery life assessments conducted by AnandTech concluded that the battery life is shorter on the iPhone 5 than its predecessor when performing certain tasks, however when performing other tasks the iPhone 5 battery outlasts the iPhone 4s.[66]

The Retina Display is 1,136 × 640 pixels with an aspect ratio of almost exactly 16:9, (minus one extra row of horizontal pixels). With a diagonal of 4" it has a display size of 6.7 square inches, compared to 5.7 in iPhone 4 and 4s.[67] The pixel density remains the same as the 4s model, which is 326 pixels per inch. Screen icons of the iPhone 5 are arranged in a matrix of six rows of four icons each. The increased screen size allows the sixth row of icons to be added to the five rows that were present in the iPhone 4. In-cell touch sensor technology from Sharp slims the screen which allows for a thinner phone. The screen's color saturation is 44% greater than its predecessor.[68]

There are three microphones (placed on the front, side and back) for noise cancellation and video calls.[69]

On April 28, 2014, Apple initiated an out of warranty recall program to replace any failing power buttons of iPhone 5 models which were manufactured prior to March 2013 at no cost.[22]

On August 23, 2014, Apple announced a program to replace batteries of iPhone 5 models that "may suddenly experience shorter battery life or need to be charged more frequently" which were sold between September 2012 and January 2013.[23][24]


Accessories
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 5, as well as the iPod Touch (5th generation), iPod Nano (7th generation), iPad (4th generation), and iPad Mini feature a new dock connector named Lightning, which replaces the 30-pin Apple Dock connector introduced in 2003 by Apple on the iPod (3rd generation). The Apple Lightning connector has eight pins and all signaling is digital. This new connector is smaller than the previous one, helping the iPhone 5 to be slimmer than its predecessors.[70] Apple Lightning cables have duplicate pins on two sides of each plug, so it can be inserted either way round. Various accessories will be available to convert the Apple Lightning connector to the older 30-pin Apple Dock connector or USB,[71] although not all old accessories will work, as not all signals are available, in particular video output and the iPod Out feature for BMW automobiles.[72][73][74]

Earphones known as Apple EarPods are included with the iPhone 5 and other devices announced at the Apple media event on September 12, 2012. They superseded earphones that were included with previous generation iPhones and iPods.[75] According to technology commentators, the redesign of the earphones is aimed to improve sound quality by allowing air to travel in and out more freely.[76][77] Apple states that the redesign of their earphones allows it to "rival high-end headphones that cost hundreds of dollars more".[76] Reviews by Gizmodo and TechRadar reported that although the redesigned earphones sounded better than its predecessor, reviewers felt that quality of sound produced is poor.[78]


Network compatibility
--------------------------------------------------
AT&T, Verizon, and Sprint offer LTE access in the US,[84] while in the UK, only EE and Three are able to offer LTE access.[85] On March 26, 2013, T-Mobile announced they would begin carrying the iPhone 5, making it the first iPhone to be available on all four nationwide carriers in the United States.[86] The T-Mobile version of the iPhone features a modified version of the A1428 iPhone 5 model enabling Advanced Wireless Services (AWS) support.[87] All carriers in Canada selling the iPhone 5 have their own LTE networks, including Rogers Wireless, Fido Solutions, Bell Mobility, Virgin Mobile Canada, Telus Mobility and Koodo Mobile.[88][89]

42 officially recognized bands exist for LTE, however rollouts are coalescing around the more-popular bands, based on what historically has been made available in specific regions. In Europe, bands available for LTE include, 2.6 GHz (the 3G-expansion band) and 800 MHz (cleared of analogue TV), with 1,800 MHz appearing in a few places including the UK. In Germany, the only carrier network supported is that of T-Mobile with its 1,800 MHz band allocated to LTE.[90][91] Some countries in Europe, including Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and others—will not be able to offer LTE connectivity via the iPhone 5 to their customers on their current LTE networks, as they have already deployed LTE in the 2.6 GHz band, which the iPhone 5 does not support.[92] In November 2012, a representative of Swisscom reported that the iPhone 5 only supports LTE on networks that have been tested and certified by Apple.[93][94]

Unlike the iPhone 4s, which was the only "world phone" produced by Apple, there are three versions of the iPhone 5, which differ by the frequency used. All three work on 2G GSM/GPRS and 3G UMTS/EDGE networks on both the 800 and 1900 MHz bands used in the Americas, and the 900 and 1800 MHz bands used elsewhere. The CDMA A1429 model works on CDMA networks, such as that of Sprint and Verizon. Another version supports LTE only on the 1700/2100 MHz AWS band, and the 700 MHz band recovered after the conversion to digital television in the US (channels 52 to 56), currently the only network that supports the band is AT&T. GSM A1429 supports several other LTE bands available in other countries, such as LTE bands 1, 3, 5.[62][95]


Reception
--------------------------------------------------

Critical reception
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 5 received mainly positive reviews from commentators and reviewers. Tim Stevens from Engadget praised the iPhone 5 for its high resolution screen surpassing that of the iPhone 4s, which he considered to be one of the best phone screens available on the market. Stevens was critical of the new connector, which is incompatible with devices and cables that use the superseded 30-pin connector, although the LA Times reported that this was a change necessary to make the device smaller than its predecessor.[70] Engadget agreed that Apple fulfilled most of the promises stated on its website, such as "better battery performance", "two times the graphics performance" and "two times faster."[96] David Pogue of The New York Times considered the 4-inch Retina display a "nice but not life-changing change", and praised the Lightning connector for its size, sturdiness, and reversibility, while noting its lack of support for older accessories, remarking that "Apple has a long history of killing off technologies, inconveniently and expensively, that the public had come to love".[97] Technology columnist Ed Baig of USA Today was impressed that Apple had met the public's "lofty expectations" for the iPhone 5 in a competitive market.[98] In a repair-ability review, iFixit found the iPhone 5 easier to disassemble and repair than its predecessor.[9][99]

Wired reported that the iPhone 5 design, carried on in the iPhone 5s and first-generation iPhone SE, was regarded as "long been the golden child of Apple phone design and a benchmark for phones in general", while the succeeding iPhone 6/6s design was less critically acclaimed as it "felt a little bit wrong, as though you were holding a slick $650 bar of soap". Wired described the iPhone 5 as "elegance rooted in the way the aluminum and glass work together. It felt streamlined, yet substantial, which is different from the iPhone 6, which feels substantial in size alone. Plus, unlike the ubiquitous rounded corners of the 6, the iPhone 5 didn't really look like anything else on the market at the time". However, the iPhone 5's design was not suited to scaling up, in contrast to the iPhone 6/6s which could better accommodate the growing consumer trend towards larger screen sizes and indeed spawned the 6/6S Plus phablet models.[100][101]


Criticism
--------------------------------------------------
Reviewers and commentators were critical of the new Maps app that replaced Google Maps in iOS 6. It had been reported to contain errors such as misplacement of landmark tags, directing users to incorrect locations and poor satellite images.[102][103][104] Nine days after Maps' release, Apple issued a statement apologizing for the frustration it had caused customers and recommending that they try alternate mapping services.[105]


Errors
--------------------------------------------------
Gizmodo editor Diaz discussed the correspondence between Apple and a reader about purple flare in pictures taken on iPhone 5 camera. Apple's response to the issue was that it is normal and advised the customer to aim the camera away from bright light sources when taking photos.[106] Tests conducted by TechCrunch indicate that the problem existed on the iPhone 4s but was more distinct and pronounced on the iPhone 5.[107] Consumer Reports found that the purple haze effect occurred on several other manufacturers' phones including the Samsung Galaxy S III and Motorola Droid Razr Maxx, and that it was not less pronounced on the iPhone 4s. The report concluded that digital cameras in general, including higher-end SLRs, can all suffer from lens flare in which a purple-tinted effect was not uncommon.[108]


Problems
--------------------------------------------------
There were anecdotal claims of the coating of primarily black iPhone 5s chipping off, exposing the bright aluminium underneath. Apple executive's response to email correspondence from an affected customer summarized that it was normal for aluminum to scratch.[109][110] The term "scuffgate", a reference to "antennagate" which affected the iPhone 4, was applied by various sources such as CNET, Yahoo News, and All Things Digital to describe the scuffing issue.[111][112]

Some users reported on the Internet that the white model leaked light behind the screen, though the issue was not unique to the iPhone 5, as it also affected other Apple devices.[113]


Commercial reception
--------------------------------------------------
Techcrunch reported that the iPhone 5 sold out twenty times faster than the 4 and 4s models. Apple said that they were "blown away by the customer response".[114] Phil Schiller, Apple's vice-president of worldwide marketing, said that over two million iPhone 5 orders had been received in the first 24 hours.[5][115] AT&T said that the iPhone 5 was the fastest-selling iPhone the company had ever offered, selling over five million units on launch weekend and exceeding the supply available.[6][116][117] The release and sale of the iPhone 5 has also slowed down the growth of Android according to market share reports released by Kantar Worldpanel ComTech.[118] During the first 16 days after the phone's initial release it comprised over 20% of all phones sold in that period.[119]

J.P. Morgan's chief economist, Michael Feroli said that "sales of iPhone 5 could boost annualized US GDP growth by $3.2 billion, or $12.8 billion at an annual rate."[120] Shortly after the announcement of the iPhone 5 and preceding the launch, Apple's stock price rose to a record $705.07,[121] but within three months fell to $507.48.[122] According to the analysis of Eric Savitz, Apple's stock decline and resulting losses were not the result of any issue with the new Maps application, but disappointed investors. He points to initial hardware sales of only five million, compared to projections up to twice that, as the primary cause.[123]

Since the release of the iPhone 5, discounts on previous generation iPhones have enabled Apple to maintain a market lead in the United States and Japan, but the iPhone continued to lag behind the combined total of Android phones in the global market.[124]

List of iPhone models

The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are smartphones that were developed and marketed by Apple Inc. They are the eighth generation of the iPhone, succeeding the iPhone 5, iPhone 5c and iPhone 5s, and were announced on September 9, 2014, and released on September 19, 2014.[20] The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus jointly were themselves replaced as the flagship devices of the iPhone series by the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus on September 9, 2015. The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus include larger 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch displays, a faster processor, upgraded cameras, improved LTE and Wi-Fi connectivity and support for a near-field communications-based mobile payments offering.[21][22]

The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus received positive reviews, with critics regarding their redesign, specifications, camera, and battery life as being improvements over previous iPhone models. However, aspects of the design of iPhone 6 were also criticized, including plastic strips on the rear of the device for its antenna that disrupted the otherwise metal exterior, and the screen resolution of the standard-sized iPhone 6 being lower than other devices in its class. The iPhone 6 sold extremely well, making it the best-selling iPhone model and the most successful smartphone to date.

The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus have been the subject of several hardware issues, including most prominently, being susceptible to bending under hard pressure (dubbed "Bendgate"), and as a byproduct of this lack of rigidity, the touchscreen's internal hardware being susceptible to losing its connection to the phone's logic board (nicknamed "Touch Disease"). Additionally, some iPhone 6 Plus models were the subject of camera issues, including some with malfunctioning optical image stabilization or otherwise defects on rear cameras.

The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were moved to the midrange spot in Apple's iPhone lineup when the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus were released in September 2015. The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were discontinued in most markets on September 7, 2016, when Apple announced the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Their spot as the entry-level iPhone was replaced by the first-generation iPhone SE, which was released earlier on March 31, 2016. The iPhone 6 was relaunched with 32 GB of storage in Asian markets in February 2017 as a midrange/budget iPhone. It was later expanded to Europe,[23][24] before hitting the US markets in May 2017,[25] and Canada in July 2017.[26] The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus supported iOS 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 before being dropped by iOS 13, and they are the third to support five versions of iOS after the iPhone 4s and the iPhone 5.


History
--------------------------------------------------
From the launch of the original iPhone to the iPhone 4s, iPhones used 3.5-inch displays—which are smaller than screens used by flagship phones from competitors. The iPhone 5 and its immediate successors featured a display that was taller, but the same width as prior models, measuring at 4 inches diagonally. Following Apple's loss in smartphone market share to companies producing phones with larger displays, reports as early as January 2014 suggested Apple was preparing to launch new iPhone models with larger, 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch displays.[27][28][29] Reports prior to its unveiling also speculated Apple might use a new iPhone model to introduce a mobile payments platform using near-field communications—a technology that was incorporated into many Android phones, but had experienced a low adoption rate among users.[30]

The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus were officially unveiled during a press event at the Flint Center for Performing Arts in Cupertino, California on September 9, 2014, and released on September 19, 2014; pre-orders began on September 12, 2014, with the iPhone 6 starting at US$199 and the iPhone 6 Plus starting at US$299.[31] In China, where the iPhone 5c and 5s were the first models in the iPhone series to be released in the country on the same day as their international launch, Apple notified local wireless carriers it would be unable to release the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus on the 19th there were "details which are not ready"; local media reported the devices had not yet been approved by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, and earlier in the year, a news report by state broadcaster China Central Television alleged iPhone devices were a threat to national security because iOS 7's "frequent locations" function could expose "state secrets."[32][33]

In August 2015, Apple initiated a replacement program for some early iPhone 6 Plus models that were found to have potentially faulty cameras that could be causing photos to appear blurry.[34][35][36]

On September 9, 2015, with the release of the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were moved to the mid-range of the iPhone lineup. The 128 GB versions of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus was discontinued along with the gold version of both phones, but the 16 GB and 64 GB versions of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in silver and space gray remained available for sale at a reduced price.[37]

In June 2016, Apple faced a potential sales ban in China, as Shenzhen Baili, a Chinese device maker, alleged the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus infringed on its design patent.[38]

The iPhone 6 was temporary discontinued on September 7, 2016, and the 6 Plus was permanently discontinued on same date, when Apple announced the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, and the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus' spot as the entry-level iPhone was taken by the first-generation iPhone SE. As the iPhone SE has more powerful internal hardware than the midrange iPhone 6 (largely the same as the 6S) and had been released earlier on March 31, 2016, this created an unusual situation when it was sold alongside the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus until September 7 despite being marketed as a lower-tier iPhone.

In February 2017, the iPhone 6 was quietly relaunched in carrier stores and online, this time the storage has been changed to 32 GB. In India, it was sold on Amazon's website in Space Grey. In Taiwan, it was sold through Taiwan Mobile on March 10 in gold color. In mid-March, it was released in the EU to Belarus via the i-Store webshop. It also makes an appearance in North America with Sprint based US prepaid carriers Boost Mobile and Virgin Mobile, along with AT&T GoPhone. These are not being distributed by Apple on their website or their retail stores.

The design of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus is influenced by that of the iPad Air with a glass front that is curved around the edges of the display, and an aluminum rear that contains two plastic strips for the antenna.[39] The back is built of 6000-series aluminum.[40] Both models come in gold, silver, and "space gray" finishes. The iPhone 6 has a thickness of 6.9 millimetres (0.27 in), while the iPhone 6 Plus is 7.1 mm (0.28 in) in thickness; both are thinner than the iPhone 5c and iPhone 5s, with the iPhone 6 being Apple's thinnest phone to date.


Displays
--------------------------------------------------
The most significant changes to the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are its displays; both branded as "Retina HD Display" and "ion-strengthened", the iPhone 6 display is 4.7 inches in size with a 16:9 resolution of 1334x750 (326 ppi, minus one row of pixels), while the iPhone 6 Plus includes a 5.5-inch 1920x1080 (1080p) display (401 PPI). The displays use a multiple-domain LCD panel, dubbed "dual-domain pixels"; the RGB pixels themselves are skewed in a pattern so every pixel is seen from a different angle. This technique helps improve the viewing angles of the display.[41]

To accommodate the larger physical size of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, the top button was renamed to "side button" and moved to the side of the phone instead of the top to improve its accessibility.[21][22]


Batteries
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 6 features a 6.91 Wh (1,810 mAh) battery, while the iPhone 6 Plus features an 11.1 Wh (2,915 mAh) battery, neither of which are user-replaceable.[citation needed]


Chipsets
--------------------------------------------------
Both models include an Apple A8 system-on-chip, and an M8 motion co-processor—an update of the M7 chip from the iPhone 5s. The primary difference between the M8 and the original M7 coprocessor is the M8 also includes a barometer to measure altitude changes. Phil Schiller said the A8 chip would provide, in comparison to the 5s, a 25% increase in CPU performance, a 50% increase in graphics performance, and less heat output. Early hands-on reports said the A8's GPU performance might indeed break away from previous generations doubling of performance at each yearly release, scoring 21204.26 in Base mark X compared to 20253.80, 10973.36 and 5034.75 on respectively the 5s, 5 and 4s.[42]


Connectivity
--------------------------------------------------
The expanded LTE connectivity on the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus is improved to LTE Advanced, with support for over 20 LTE bands (seven more than the iPhone 5s),[43] for up to 150 Mbit/s download speed, and VoLTE support. Wi-Fi performance has been improved with support for 802.11ac specifications, providing speeds up to 433.0581 Mbit/s—which is up to three times faster than 802.11n,[43] along with Wi-Fi Calling support where available. The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus adds support for near-field communications (NFC). It is initially used exclusively for Apple Pay—a new mobile payments system which allows users to store their credit cards in Passbook for use with online payments and retail purchases over NFC.[44][45] iOS 11 added limited use of near-field communications besides Apple Pay for 3rd party apps.[46]


Camera
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 6's rear-facing camera now has the ability to shoot 1080p Full HD video at either 30 or 60 frames per second and 720p HD slow-motion video at either 120 or 240 frames per second, while the iPhone 5s could only record at 30 and 120 frames per second respectively.[citation needed] Unlike the previous models, the rear-facing camera is not flush with the rear of the device, but instead protrudes slightly.[47]

Still photos can be captured during video recording. Those have a resolution of four megapixels (2720×1532).[48][49]

The camera also includes phase detection autofocus.[50] The iPhone 6 Plus camera is nearly identical, but also includes optical image stabilization.[21][22] The front-facing camera was also updated with a new sensor and f/2.2 aperture, along with support for burst and HDR modes.[21][22]

However, the optical image stabilization of the iPhone 6 Plus is only available for photography and deactivated during video recording.[14]

The front camera has 1.3 Megapixels and records video up to 720p at 30 frames per second.[12]


Sensors
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus are the first iPhones to be equipped with a barometer sensor.[51]

Like the predecessor, the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus are equipped with an accelerometer, gyroscope, front-facing proximity sensor and a digital compass.[12]


Software
--------------------------------------------------
When first released, the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus were supplied pre-loaded with iOS 8. Apps are able to take advantage of the increased screen size in the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus to display more information on-screen; for example, the Mail app uses a dual-pane layout similar to its iPad version when the device is in landscape mode on the iPhone 6 Plus. As it uses an identical aspect ratio, apps designed for the iPhone 5, iPhone 5c, and 5s can be upscaled for use on the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. To improve the usability of the devices' larger screens, an additional "Reachability" gesture was added; double-tapping the Home button will slide the top half of the screen's contents down to the bottom half of the screen. This function allows users to reach buttons located near the top of the screen, such as a "Back" button in the top-left corner.[21][22] Tapping it once resets the screen timeout so the user does not have to look at the screen for an empty spot to tap on.[52]

In June 2019, Apple announced that it would drop support for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus with the release of iOS 13.[53][54][55]


Reception
--------------------------------------------------
Both iPhone 6 models received positive reviews. Re/code called it "the best smartphone you can buy".[56] TechRadar praised the iPhone 6's "brilliant" design, improved battery life over the 5s, iOS 8 for being "smarter and more intuitive than ever", along with the quality of its camera. However, the plastic antenna strips on the rear of the phone were criticized for resulting in poor aesthetics, the display for having lower resolution and pixel density in comparison to other recent smartphones – including those with the same physical screen size as the iPhone 6, such as the HTC One, and for not having a sufficient justification for its significantly higher price in comparison to similar devices running Android or Windows Phone.[57] The Verge considered the iPhone 6 to be "simply and cleanly designed" in comparison to the 5s, noting the phone still felt usable despite its larger size, but criticized the antenna plastic, the protruding camera lens (which prevents the device from sitting flat without a case), and the lack of additional optimization in the operating system for the bigger screen. Improvements such as performance, battery life, VoLTE support, and other tweaks were also noted. In conclusion, the iPhone 6 was considered "good, even great, but there's little about it that's truly ambitious or truly moving the needle. It's just a refinement of a lot of existing ideas into a much more pleasant package".[39]

In regards to the 6 Plus, Engadget panned its design for being uncomfortable to hold and harder to grip in comparison to other devices such as the Galaxy Note 3 and LG G3, but praised its inclusion of optical image stabilization and slightly better battery life than the 6.[50]

The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus have been criticized by Forbes Magazine for the lack of 2160p (3840×2160 pixels) video recording due to the insufficient image sensor resolution of 3264×2448 pixels. However, third-party software is able to record footage at 3264×1836 pixels upscaled to 3840×2160p.[58]


Issues
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were affected by a number of notable hardware-related issues, including but not limited to concerns surrounding their rigidity (which led to incidents surrounding chassis bending, as well as degradation or outright loss of touchscreen functionality), performance issues on models with larger storage capacity, camera problems on the 6 Plus model, as well as an initially undocumented "error 53" that appeared under certain circumstances.




Bendgate (chassis bending)
--------------------------------------------------
Shortly after its public release, it was reported the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus chassis was susceptible to bending under pressure, such as when carried tightly in a user's pocket. While such issues are not exclusive to the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, the design flaw came to be known among users and the media as "Bendgate".[59][60]

Apple responded to the bending allegations, stating they had only received nine complaints of bent devices and that the damage occurring due to regular use is "extremely rare." The company maintained the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus went through durability testing to ensure they would stand up to daily use.[61] The company offered to replace phones that were bent if it is determined the bending was unintentional.[59]

In May 2018, as part of a lawsuit against Apple regarding touchscreen failure, it was revealed via internal documents that Apple knew the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus phones were more likely to bend than previous models. According to the court documents, Apple's internal tests found the iPhone 6 was 3.3 times more likely to bend than the iPhone 5s, while the larger iPhone 6 Plus was 7.2 times more likely to bend.[62][63]


Hair ripping
--------------------------------------------------
On October 3, 2014 9to5Mac released a post claiming certain iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus users complained on social networking sites the phone ripped off their hair when they held the phone close to their ears when making phone calls.[64] Twitter users claimed the seam between the glass screen and aluminum back of the iPhone 6 was to blame, with hair becoming caught within it.[65][66]


Flash storage performance
--------------------------------------------------
Some users reported the 64 and 128 GB iPhone 6 models had experienced performance issues, and that some 128 GB iPhone 6 Plus models would, in rare cases, randomly crash and reboot. Business Korea reported the issues were connected to the triple-level cell NAND storage of the affected models. Triple-level NAND flash can store three bits of data per cell of flash, and are cheaper than dual-level cell solutions, but at the cost of performance. It was reported Apple had planned to switch the affected model lines back to multi-level cell flash, and address the performance issues on existing devices in a future iOS update.[67][68][69]


iPhone 6/6 Plus camera issues
--------------------------------------------------
It was reported the optical image stabilization systems on some iPhone 6 Plus models were faulty, failing to properly stabilize when the phone is being held perfectly still, leading to blurry photos and "wavy"-looking videos.[70] The optical image stabilization system was also found to have been affected by accessories that use magnets, such as third-party lens attachments; Apple issued advisories to users and its licensed accessory makers, warning magnetic or metallic accessories can cause the OIS to malfunction.[71]

On August 21, 2015, Apple instituted a repair program for iPhone 6 Plus models released between September 2014 and January 2015, citing faulty rear cameras on affected models may produce blurry pictures.[34][35][36]

Some iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus models have an issue in which the front-facing camera is somehow "shifted", or out of place. Apple stated they would replace most affected iPhone 6 models with this issue, free of charge. Despite numerous complaints regarding this issue, it does not seem to affect the camera itself. It is said the camera is not what has shifted, but a piece of protective foam around the camera module itself that has gone out of place.[72]


"Error 53"
--------------------------------------------------
If the iPhone 6 home button is repaired or modified by a third party, the device will fail security checks related to Touch ID as the components have not been "re-validated" for security reasons—a process that can only be performed by an authorized Apple outlet. Failing these checks disables all features related to Touch ID. Such effects have sometimes happened as a result of damage as well.[73][74]

It was reported these same hardware integrity checks would trigger an unrecoverable loop into "Recovery Mode" if iOS is updated or restored, with attempts to restore the device via iTunes software resulting in an "error 53" message. Beyond the explanation this is related to hardware integrity errors regarding Touch ID components, Apple provided no official explanation of what specifically triggers error 53 or how it can be fixed without replacing the entire device.[73][74]

On February 18, 2016, Apple released an iOS 9.2.1 patch through iTunes which addresses this issue and admitted error 53 was actually related to a diagnostic check for inspecting the Touch ID hardware before an iPhone is shipped from its factories.[75]


Touchscreen failure ("touch disease")
--------------------------------------------------
Touchscreen control components on iPhone 6 logic boards have insufficient support, including a lack of underfill—which strengthens and stabilizes integrated circuits, and a lack of rigid metal shielding on the logic board unlike previous iPhone models; the touchscreen controller is instead shielded by a flexible "sticker". Normal use of the device can cause the logic board to flex internally, which strains the touchscreen IC connectors and leads to a degradation or outright loss of touchscreen functionality. A symptom that has been associated with this type of failure is a flickering grey bar near the top of the display.[76][77] iFixit reported this issue, nicknamed "touch disease",[76][78][79] was a byproduct of the previous "Bendgate" design flaw because of the device's demonstrated lack of rigidity. As such, the larger iPhone 6 Plus is more susceptible to the flaw, but it has also been reported on a small percentage of iPhone 6 models.[79][80][81] The devices' successor, the iPhone 6s, is not afflicted by this flaw due to changes to their internal design, which included the strengthening of "key points" in the rear casing, and the re-location of the touchscreen controllers to the display assembly from the logic board.[80]

Initially, Apple did not officially acknowledge this issue. The issue was widely discussed on Apple's support forum—where posts discussing the issue have been subject to censorship.[77] The touchscreen can be repaired via microsoldering: Apple Stores are not equipped with the tools needed to perform the logic board repair, which had led to affected users sending their devices to unofficial, third-party repair services. An Apple Store employee interviewed by Apple Insider reported six months after they first started noticing the problem, Apple had issued guidance instructing them to tell affected users this was a hardware issue that could not be repaired and that their iPhone had to be replaced. However, some in-stock units have also been afflicted with this issue out of the box, leading to an employee stating they were "tired of pulling service stock out of the box, and seeing the exact same problem the customer has on the replacement".[81][82] The issue received mainstream attention in August 2016 when reported by iFixit.[76][79][81] On August 26, 2016, Apple Insider reported based on data from four "high-traffic" Apple Store locations, there was a spike in the number of iPhone 6 devices brought into them for repairs following mainstream reports of the "touch disease" problem.[82]

On August 30, 2016, a group of three iPhone 6 owners sued Apple Inc. in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California and filed for a proposed class action lawsuit, alleging Apple was engaging in unfair business practices by having "long been aware" of the defective design, yet refusing to acknowledge or repair it.[78][83][84]

On November 17, 2016, Apple officially acknowledged the issue and announced a paid repair program for affected iPhone 6 Plus models, stating; "some iPhone 6 Plus devices may exhibit display flickering or Multi-Touch issues after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device".[85]


Sales
--------------------------------------------------
Apple Inc. announced, within 24 hours of availability, over 4 million pre-orders of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were made, exceeding the supply available—an Apple record.[86] 10 million iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus devices were sold in the first three days, marking another Apple record. The iPhone 6S & 6S Plus were introduced in September 2015 selling 13 million units which set the record for sales in the first three days from last years release.[87] Three months after its release, the iPhone 6 generated 71.5 million unit sales.[88]

As of June 2017, the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus have sold 222.4 million units worldwide, making them the most popular iPhone models and the best-selling smartphones of all time.[89][88]

List of iPhone models

The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus[a] are smartphones that were developed and marketed by Apple Inc. They are the tenth generation of the iPhone. They were announced on September 7, 2016, at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco by Apple CEO Tim Cook, and were released on September 16, 2016, succeeding the iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus as the flagship devices in the iPhone series. Apple also released the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in numerous countries worldwide throughout September and October 2016. They were succeeded as flagship devices by the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus[12] on September 12, 2017, and were discontinued with the announcement of the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro on September 10, 2019.

The iPhone 7's overall design is similar to the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S. Changes introduced included new color options (Matte Black and Jet Black), water and dust resistance, a new capacitive, static home button, revised antenna bands, and the controversial removal of the 3.5 mm headphone jack. The device's internal hardware received upgrades, including a heterogeneous quad-core system-on-chip with improved system and graphics performance, upgraded 12 megapixel rear-facing cameras with optical image stabilization on all models, and an additional telephoto lens exclusive to the iPhone 7 Plus to provide enhanced (2x) optical zoom capabilities and portrait mode. The front camera is the first in the series with 1080p (Full HD) video resolution. The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus were supported from iOS 10 to iOS 15, and they are the third to support six versions of iOS before support was terminated, after the iPhone 5s.

The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus were the last iPhones using a quad-core CPU, as well as an aluminum unibody design without wireless charging and a base model starting at 32 GB of internal storage.

The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus were the only iPhones to have a jet black color finish.


History
--------------------------------------------------
Prior to its announcement, multiple aspects of the iPhone 7 were heavily rumoured. Apple's plans to remove the 3.5 mm headphone jack received significant media attention.[b] Other rumors included a flush camera, stereo speakers,[17] a 256 gigabyte storage option, and a larger 3,100 mAh battery.[18]

On August 29, 2016, invitations to a press event at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco, California on September 7, 2016, were sent out to members of the media, prompting immediate speculation of the iPhone 7's upcoming announcement.[19][20] The iPhone 7 was officially announced at that event, with pre-orders beginning September 9, and general availability on September 16.[21][22][23]

The iPhone 7 launched in 30 new countries later in September, with further international rollouts throughout October and November 2016.[c] Indonesia was the last country to release the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, with availability starting on March 31, 2017, following Apple's research and development investment in the country.[31]

On March 21, 2017, Apple announced an iPhone 7 with a red color finish (and white front), as part of its partnership with Product Red to highlight its AIDS fundraising campaign. It launched on March 24, 2017,[32][33] but it was later discontinued after the announcement of the iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X in September 2017 as well as the 256 GB Variant.[34]

On September 12, 2017, Apple announced the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus as direct successors to the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus,[35] alongside the iPhone X.[36]

The iPhone 7 & 7 Plus, as well as the iPhone XS and its Max variant were discontinued and removed from Apple's website after the announcement of the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro on September 10, 2019. They are no longer available for sale.

On June 6, 2022, Apple announced on its website that the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus will not receive support for iOS 16. Controversially, the iPad (5th generation), which has the A9 chip, received iPadOS 16, along with the 6th and 7th generation iPads, which have almost identical hardware to the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus respectively.[37]


Specifications
--------------------------------------------------

Design
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 7's exterior is similar in shape and volume to the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S, although the camera bump is bigger on the iPhone 7. Alongside the existing silver, gold, and rose gold colors, the device is offered in new colors of matte black, glossy "jet black",[21] and, for a limited time, red.[32][33] The "jet black" color is a dark shade, high-gloss black finish. It is created through a multi-step process, beginning with an anodization phase to make the surface of the casing a porous aluminum oxide, and then using a machine to sweep the casing through a powdered compound, absorbed by aluminum oxide. The process is concluded with an "ultrafine particle bath" for additional finishing; the entire process takes less than an hour.[38]


Water protection
--------------------------------------------------
iPhone 7 is rated IP67 water and dust resistant, making it the first officially water-resistant iPhone,[39] although tests have resulted in malfunctions, specifically distorted speakers, after water exposure.[40] The warranty does not cover any water damage to the phone.[41]


Home button
--------------------------------------------------
iPhone 7's home button uses a capacitive mechanism for input rather than a physical push-button, as on previous models, meaning direct skin contact (or a capacitive glove) is required to operate the device.[42][43] Physical feedback is provided via a Taptic Engine vibrator, and the button is also pressure-sensitive.[44] iPhone 7 retains the 3D Touch display system introduced on the iPhone 6S, providing pressure-sensitive touchscreen input.[21]


Headphone plug removal
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are the first iPhones not to feature a 3.5mm headphone jack. It was replaced by a second speaker grille that serves as a vent for the internal barometer.[45] A Lightning-to-3.5-mm-connector adapter, as well as in-ear headphones that use the Lightning connector, were bundled with the device,[21] and the adapter is also sold separately as an accessory.[46] The adapter is also compatible with other iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch devices running iOS 10 and newer.[47]


Hardware
--------------------------------------------------

Chipsets
--------------------------------------------------
iPhone 7 uses the Apple A10 Fusion 64-bit system-on-chip, which consists of two low-power cores and two high-power cores (only two cores are used at any point in time[48]). The A10 chip also features a hexa-core graphics chip capable of "console-level gaming".[49] As with prior models, iPhone 7 is available in two sizes: one with a 4.7 in (120 mm) screen, and a "Plus" variant with a 5.5 in (140 mm) screen.[50] The displays have identical sizes and resolutions to iPhone 6S, but with a wider color gamut[21] and increased brightness.[51] The screen-to-body ratio is about ~66% and ~68% for the 7 and 7 Plus, respectively.[52][53]

Both device variants also contain a new iteration of Apple's motion coprocessor, the M10.[54] Unlike previous iPhone models, internal storage options for iPhone 7 begin at 32 GB instead of 16 GB, and max out at 256 GB.[55] iPhone 7 Plus offers 3 GB of RAM, more than any other previous iPhone;[48] the 4.7-inch iPhone 7 has 2 GB.[56]


Cameras
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 7 includes a 12-megapixel rear-facing camera with a quad-LED "True Tone" flash; its aperture was widened to f/1.8, and the standard-size phone model adds optical image stabilization – a feature that was previously exclusive to Plus models.[57]

The iPhone 7 Plus includes a second 12-megapixel telephoto lens, which can be used to achieve 2× optical zoom, and up to 10× digital zoom. However, the telephoto camera has an f/2.8 aperture and lacks optical image stabilization.[58]

The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus record video with single-channel mono audio.[59]

Still photos with 6.5 megapixels (3412×1920) can be captured during video recording.[60]

The front-facing camera was upgraded to a 7-megapixel sensor with automatic image stabilization.[21][61]

The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are the first iPhones to be able to record 1080p video using the front camera.[62]


Battery life
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 7 has a 1,960 mAh battery which can last about 3–5 hours. The iPhone 7 Plus has 2,900 mAh battery and can last for 5–8 hours.


Software
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 7 originally shipped with iOS 10 pre-installed.[63] The iPhone 7 Plus received an exclusive portrait camera mode in the iOS 10.1 software update.[64] This camera mode is capable of producing a bokeh effect using depth of field analysis of the second camera of dual-lens in the back of iPhone 7 Plus. Mainstream software support for the iPhone 7 was dropped when iOS 16 was released.[65][66] But, it still receives iOS 15 security updates (as of January 22, 2024). The current version of iOS to support iPhone 7 is iOS 15.8.3.[67] The device can also run Android 10 unofficially via a project called Project Sandcastle made by Corellium, a security research company that produces paid iOS, Android, and IoT emulators.[68] Ubuntu 20.04 "Focal Fossa" has also been ported via Project Sandcastle.[69]


Accessories
--------------------------------------------------
Each iPhone 7 originally came with a Lightning-to-3.5-mm adapter,[21] although this was omitted starting on September 12, 2018.[70] Apple sells the adapter independently as well.[46] iPhone 7 does not have a built-in DAC, a Cirrus Logic CS4272 DAC is included as part of the adapter. Apple also unveiled several Bluetooth wireless headphones ostensibly intended for use with the iPhone 7, including AirPods, wireless in-ear headphones, and three new Beats headphone products. All four products utilize an in-house wireless chip known as the Apple W1, which is designed to provide low-power Bluetooth operation and integration with iOS and macOS devices (though they are still compatible with other Bluetooth-supported devices).[71][72]


Reception
--------------------------------------------------
Reception of the iPhone 7 was mixed. Although reviewers noted improvements to the camera, especially the dual rear camera on the Plus model, the phone was criticized for the lack of innovation in its build quality. Many reviews panned the removal of the 3.5 mm headphone jack; some critics argued that the change was meant to bolster licensing of the proprietary Lightning connector and the sales of Apple's own wireless headphone products, and questioned the effects of the change on audio quality. Apple was also mocked by critics for Phil Schiller's statement that such a drastic change required "courage".

Gordon Kelly of Forbes noted that rival smartphones, such as the Samsung Galaxy S7, had increased battery life and added water resistance over its predecessor while retaining the headphone jack, and that the iPhone 7's camera photo quality was improved but still lagging behind some phones already on the market, including the Galaxy S7 and Nexus 6P. Kelly praised how Apple was able to extract improved brightness and accurate color reproduction from its LCD display panel, while noting that it was old technology which was also well behind rivals who had already moved to sharper 1080p or even 2K screens. The iPhone 7's exterior, which reuses the aging design of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S, was criticized, especially the size of the device and thick top/bottom bezels, with Kelly writing that "the iPhone 7 Plus is simply far too big for a smartphone with a 5.5-inch display".[73]

Nilay Patel of The Verge described the device as being "full of aggressive breaks from convention," noting the headphone jack removal, heterogeneous CPU, and home button redesign, going as far as dubbing it "a prototype of next year's rumored drastic iPhone redesign disguised as an iPhone 6." The display quality was considered an improvement over previous models, albeit "not as insane" as the quad HD displays on competing phones. The Taptic Engine was considered the "first really valuable new UI concept I've seen on phones in years" (as opposed to the "gimmick" of 3D Touch), Patel felt that the cameras of the devices were a step above the 6S in terms of performance, and praised the dual-lens camera on the 7 Plus for enhancing the phone's camera functionality. However, he panned the lack of editing features that made use of them. In regards to the enhanced Bluetooth audio support provided by devices containing the W1 chip, he argued that Apple "took away an established open standard in favor of new technologies, but instead of making the experience of using those new technologies better across the board, it made every third-party wireless audio product a second-class citizen of the Apple ecosystem." Giving the iPhone 7 a 9 out of 10, he concluded that the devices were "legitimately among the most interesting, opinionated, powerful phones Apple has ever shipped, and the most confident expressions of the company's vision in a long time. iOS 10 is excellent, the cameras are better, and the performance is phenomenal. And the batteries last longer."[74]

John McCann of TechRadar wrote that for the first time, the phablet-sized iPhone 7 Plus was "markedly better" than the smaller model. He highlighted improved battery life and praised the camera, calling the Plus' dual cameras "excellent" for point-and-shoot, and "much improved" for low-light performance. McCann wrote that the lack of a headphone jack was "initially frustrating", but noted that it was a "positive step forward for the mobile industry", despite the "short-term effects ... making the most noise for now".[75]


Headphone jack controversy
--------------------------------------------------
Criticism of the iPhone 7 centered around the removal of the headphone jack, including the inability to use wired headphones with the included adapter and charge the device simultaneously.[d][77]

In a particularly scathing article, Nilay Patel of The Verge wrote that removing the headphone jack, "a deeply established standard" as he put it, would be "user-hostile and stupid". He goes on to list reasons why removing the port is negative, concluding with "No one is asking for this" and "Vote with your dollars".[78]

Gordon Kelly of Forbes noted that wireless audio technology was immature at the moment, with Bluetooth audio quality being inferior and Lightning's audio reliability still in question. The removal of the headphone jack meant that in Patel's words, "You're being pushed into an era where you will have to pay more for decent headphones due to their need for an integrated DAC and/or Lightning licensing", and pointed out that "the only company to profit from this situation is Apple, who will now be charging licensing fees to millions of headphone companies".[73]

In particular, Apple's vice president Phil Schiller, who announced the change, was mocked extensively online for stating that removing the headphone jack took 'courage'.[79][80] An online petition created by the consumer group SumOfUs, that accuses Apple of planned obsolescence and causing substantial electronic waste by removing the headphone jack,[81] reached over 300,000 signatures.[82]


Issues
--------------------------------------------------

Hissing noises
--------------------------------------------------
Some users have reported a strange hissing noise during heavy usage of the phone. CNET reports it as "faint buzzes and hums coming from the backside".[83] The Daily Telegraph speculates that the iPhone 7's new A10 Fusion processor is the source of the noise, linking to tweets that compare the phone's hissing sound to "hearing the fans spin up loudly whenever your Mac's CPU gets used to its actual potential."[84]


Performance differences
--------------------------------------------------
The Guardian reported in October 2016 that storage tests from Unbox Therapy and GSMArena showed that the 32 GB iPhone 7 is "significantly" slower than the 128 and 256 GB versions, measuring data write speeds of 341 MB/s on a 128 GB iPhone 7 model versus 42 MB/s on a 32 GB model.[85] October 2016 network tests by Cellular Insights showed that models A1660 and A1661 with Qualcomm modems had "a significant performance edge" over models A1778 and A1784 with Intel modems. Inspection of the modems also found that the Qualcomm version's ability to use Ultra HD Voice had been turned off, likely to "level the playing field between the Qualcomm, and Intel variants". The report concluded with the statement that "We are not sure what was the main reason behind Apple's decision to source two different modem suppliers for the newest iPhone".[86][87] Bloomberg reported in November 2016 that tests by researchers from Twin Prime and Cellular Insights had shown the two modems to perform similarly on some U.S. cellular networks despite one of the modems being technically capable of faster connectivity. Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller told the publication that "Every iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus meets or exceeds all of Apple's wireless performance standards, quality metrics, and reliability testing ... In all of our rigorous lab tests based on wireless industry standards, in thousands of hours of real-world field testing, and in extensive carrier partner testing, the data shows there is no discernible difference in the wireless performance of any of the models". Bloomberg quoted analysts and technology advisers who stated that "[Apple] don't want one version to get the reputation that it is better" and that "This may not impact the fanboys, but it may make other consumers think twice about buying an Apple phone, especially if they think they might be purchasing a sub-standard product".[88]


Perception of slogan in Cantonese-speaking regions
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 7's "This is 7" slogan has been misunderstood when translated to certain other languages.[89][90] The phone's slogan in Mainland China is "7, is here;" (Chinese: 7，在此; pinyin: 7, zài cǐ), while in Hong Kong, its slogan is, "This, is iPhone 7;" (Chinese: 這，就是iPhone 7; Jyutping: ze5, zau6 si6 iPhone 7).

In Cantonese, the local language of Hong Kong, the slogan could be mistakenly interpreted as "This is penis". "Tsat", (Chinese: 杘; Jyutping: cat6), is a common slang term for an erect penis, and "seven", (Chinese: 七; Jyutping: cat1), which varies only in tone, is often used as a euphemism.[citation needed]


Replacing the home button
--------------------------------------------------
In the iPhone 7, Apple added a software lock that prevents individuals from attempting to replace the home button on their own. Users are now required to go to an Apple Store to have repairs done, with "recalibration" of the button being necessary. This is a step further than Apple went with iPhone 5S, 6 and 6S, where only Touch ID functionality would get disabled but the "return-to-home" functionality still worked.[91][92]


Failure to connect to cellular service
--------------------------------------------------
Some iPhone 7 devices with the model numbers A1660, A1779 and A1780 suffer from a problem where they show a "No service" message even when cellular reception is available. Apple will repair those devices for free within four years of the first retail sale of the unit.[93]


Loop disease
--------------------------------------------------
Some iPhone 7 devices suffer from a problem that affects audio in the device. Users reported a grayed-out speaker button during calls, grayed-out voice memo icon, and occasional freezing of the device. A few users also complained that lightning EarPods failed to work with the device and that the Wi-Fi button would be grayed out after restarting the iPhone. On May 4, 2018, Apple acknowledged the issue through an internal memo. If an affected iPhone 7 was no longer covered by warranty, Apple said its service providers could request an exception for this particular issue. The exemptions abruptly ended in July 2018 when Apple deleted the internal document. Many customers have complained Apple has charged customers around $350 to fix the issue. Many customers complain the issue first appeared after a software update.


Sales
--------------------------------------------------
Apple has deliberately withheld pre-order sales numbers, citing that these are "no longer a representative metric for our investors and customers".[94] Without releasing specific numbers, T-Mobile US stated that the iPhone 7 had broken the carrier's all-time record for first-day pre-order sales. The following weekend, T-Mobile US stated that iPhone 7 was its biggest iPhone launch ever, being "up nearly 4x compared to the next most popular iPhone".[95]

On September 14, 2016, two days before the iPhone 7 went on sale, Apple announced that due to high demand, they had sold out of all "jet black" iPhone 7's, and all colors of the iPhone 7 Plus.[96] This caused issues for customers in the iPhone Upgrade Program, who were unable to reserve new phones.[97] After customer complaints and a class action lawsuit,[98] Apple made changes to ensure members of the program could get new phones as soon as possible.[99]

In May 2017, analytics research company Strategy Analytics announced that iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus were the best-selling smartphones worldwide during the first quarter of 2017, selling 21.5 million and 17.4 million units, respectively.[100][101]


US carrier trade-in deals
--------------------------------------------------
For the initial U.S. sales of the iPhone 7, all four major wireless carriers announced trade-in deals. Under the deals, the monthly installment plan cost of the iPhone 7 is negated by a monthly credit on consumers' bill, but consumers who cancel their service with the carrier or pay off the phone prior to the installment contract completion will not receive credits for the remaining months.[102] Jacob Kastrenakes of The Verge noted that the deals effectively constituted a return to two-year phone contracts, in which the deals "essentially lock you into that carrier for two years".[103]

In the wake of these deals, Verizon announced they had seen an increase in sales over the release of the previous year's iPhone 6S, AT&T said that sales had exceeded its expectations, and T-Mobile and Sprint announced "huge increases in sales", with T-Mobile seeing a demand roughly four times higher for the 7 than the 6.[104]


Reports about trimmed production
--------------------------------------------------
In December 2016, DigiTimes reported that Apple had reduced production of the iPhone 7 because of decreasing demand for the product after the initial surge of interest waned. A reason cited was consumers and suppliers turning their attention to next year's iPhone model.[105][106]

A new report from Nikkei at the end of December included details on sales and production of the iPhone 7. The report, "based on data from suppliers", stated that Apple would trim production of the iPhone 7 by 10% in the first quarter of 2017, following "sluggish" sales. Nikkei reported that Apple previously trimmed production of the iPhone 7 by 20% due to accumulated inventory of the previous model, but that the new models had "sold more sluggishly than expected". Additionally, the report notes that the "iPhone 7 Plus, which features two cameras on its back face, remains popular", but "a shortage of camera sensors has curbed Apple's ability to meet demand for the phones".[107]

List of iPhone models

The iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus are smartphones developed and marketed by Apple Inc. They are the eleventh generation of the iPhone. The iPhone 8 was released on September 22, 2017, succeeding the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, respectively.[9]

The designs of the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus are largely similar to that of their predecessors except for the addition of a glass back. The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus were the final flagship iPhone models to feature the home button and Touch ID. Notable changes include the removal of the rose gold and jet black color variants,[10] addition of inductive charging, a faster processor, and improved cameras and displays. The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus share most of their internal hardware with the iPhone X.

The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus were discontinued as of February 2020, having sold 86.3 million units worldwide, making them one of the best-selling smartphones of all time.[11][12][original research?] They initially shipped with iOS 11 and supported up to iOS 16, and do not support iOS 17.[13]

The second and third generations of the entry level iPhone SE retain the iPhone 8's exterior dimensions and Touch ID, with upgraded hardware.


History
--------------------------------------------------
Apple invited the press to a media event at the Steve Jobs Theater in the Apple Park campus on September 12, 2017.[14] The iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus were announced at that event, and released on September 22, 2017.[15]

On April 9, 2018, Apple introduced an iPhone 8 with a red color finish and a black front, in support of their partnership with Product Red and their AIDS fundraising campaign.[16]

In November 2018, just over a year from initial release, Apple started selling refurbished iPhone 8 models starting at $499.[17] The price was lowered to US$319.[18] Refurbished iPhone 8 Plus models were available starting at $599.[19] The price was also subsequently lowered to US$469 and later to $359.[20]

On April 15, 2020, Apple announced the second-generation iPhone SE and discontinued the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, which share the external form factor but has upgraded internals including an A13 Bionic processor.[21][22] On March 8, 2022, Apple announced the third-generation iPhone SE with the same exterior dimensions, but with an upgraded camera and Apple's A15 processor.


Specifications
--------------------------------------------------

Hardware
--------------------------------------------------

Display
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus retain the Retina HD Display found in the iPhone 7,[23] but they now feature True Tone technology, allowing for automatic screen adjustments based on surrounding ambient lighting.[15] They can play HDR10 and Dolby Vision content despite not having an HDR-ready display, done by down-converting the HDR content to fit the display while still having some enhancements to dynamic range, contrast, and wide color gamut compared to standard content.[24]


Camera
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus feature a 12 MP camera with autofocus, f/1.8 aperture and optical image stabilization capable of capturing 4K video at 24, 30, or 60 frames per second, or 1080p video at 30, 60, 120 or 240 frames per second,[25] and a Quad LED True Tone Flash with Slow Sync.[26] The Slow Sync flash, 4K 60fps, and 1080p 240 fps options are new features for the 8 and 8 Plus, over the options available on the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus.

The iPhone 8 Plus, like the iPhone 7 Plus, adds a second, telephoto, lens. A new AI-driven option is available for the iPhone 8 Plus, called Portrait Lighting--making use of the more capable image signal processor in the A11 SoC.[26]

Both models have a 7 MP front camera with an f/2.2 aperture capable of capturing 1080p video at 30 frames per second and 720p video at 24 frames per second, along with face detection and high-dynamic range.[25][27]

The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus record videos with single channel audio (mono).[28]

Still photos with 6.5 megapixels (3412×1920) can be captured during video recording.[29]


Chipset
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus contain the Apple A11 Bionic system-on-chip, a hexa-core processor that the company says features two performance cores that are 25% faster than those found in the iPhone 7's A10 processor and four efficiency cores that are 70% faster than those in the prior model. The phones also feature an Apple-designed graphics processing unit 30% faster than prior units, with the same level of performance as the A10 at half the power.[15]


Other
--------------------------------------------------
The phones have glass backs instead of the complete aluminum housing found on prior models, enabling the use of Qi inductive charging.[15] The phones are rated IP67 for water resistance and dust resistance. [30] Both models come with 64, 128, and 256 gigabytes storage options,[31][32] and are offered in silver, gold, or Space Gray color options.[15] A Product Red special edition version in red with a black front was released on April 9, 2018.[16] The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus were the last iPhones with white front in Silver and Gold colors.

In addition to Qi wireless charging, the iPhone 8 also supports wired charging using Apple's proprietary Lightning connector. It can fast-charge from a charger providing USB Power Delivery combined with a special USB-C to Lightning adapter cable supporting fast charging.[33]

The iPhone 8 has a 6 out of 10 reparability score from iFixit, mainly due to the use of excessive glue for the back glass.[34]


Software
--------------------------------------------------
Both the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus were supplied with iOS 11 on launch,[25][27] and support iOS 12, iOS 13, iOS 14, iOS 15 and iOS 16. Apple announced that the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, as well as the iPhone X, would not support iOS 17 due to hardware limitations.[35] However, the devices still receive security updates.


Reception
--------------------------------------------------
Reception of the phones was generally positive, with reviewers praising the addition of inductive charging, fast charge capability, and the new Apple A11 processor, while criticizing the aging design that was introduced with the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in 2014.

Samuel Axon of Ars Technica called the A11 processor "a marvelous feat of engineering", writing that it offers "industry-leading performance". Axon also praised the cameras, writing that "The colors are great, and low light performance is very good for a smartphone".[36] Chris Velazco of Engadget praised the speed of the A11 processor, the build quality and the "excellent" camera, while criticizing design familiarities with previous iPhone generations and limited water-protection levels compared to competitors.[37]

John McCann of TechRadar enjoyed the feel of the glass back despite criticizing the phone's overall design. McCann also praised the camera and called inductive charging a "useful" addition to the iPhone lineup.[38]

David Pierce of Wired similarly stated that the iPhone 8 models were overshadowed by the iPhone X, despite calling them "virtually perfect phones". Pierce praised performance, cameras, and displays, while repeatedly criticizing the "outdated" design.[39]

Nilay Patel of The Verge called the iPhone 8 the "default option", noting that the 8 models stand as almost universally overlooked by Apple's other new iPhone launched, the iPhone X. He nevertheless praised the device's form factor for being easy and non-slippery to hold and the display's addition of True Tone technology and upgraded speakers, though he cited issues with inductive charging speed through wireless pads as well as the price of the iPhone 8 Plus 256 GB, which was close to that of the iPhone X. Patel also criticized the iPhone 8's aging design, dating back to the iPhone 6 released in 2014; the most notable critique was of the thick bezels when compared to other 2017 smartphones, designed with nearly bezel-less faces to incorporate larger screens in a similar form factor.[40]

The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus were also criticized for their durability, as drop tests performed showed that the rear glass is not "the most durable glass ever in a smartphone", as claimed by Apple.[41][42]

Camera testing company DxOMark gave the camera on the iPhone 8 a rating of 92 and 8 Plus a rating of 94, giving them the title of best smartphone cameras tested by the company.[43][44] The Samsung Galaxy Note 8 later matched the iPhone 8 Plus with an identical overall score of 94.[45][46] They were later overtaken by the Google Pixel 2, which scored a 98 rating.[47]

Although being the first mobile phone to record 2160p at 60 frames per second, the iPhone 8, 8 Plus and X have been criticized in a review by GSMArena for its mono (single-channel) audio recording for videos, while stereo audio recording for videos has been available on competing mobile phone models for several years, such as the Samsung Galaxy S3 and Sony Xperia S from 2012.[28][48][49]


Issues
--------------------------------------------------
On August 31, 2018, Apple announced that a "very small percentage" of iPhone 8 devices released between September 2017 and March 2018 contained a manufacturing defect in the logic board. This fault affected iPhone 8 models sold in Australia, China, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Macau, New Zealand, and the United States. Defective devices may experience unexpected reboots, a frozen or unresponsive screen, or may fail to turn on. Users with an affected device, as determined by their serial number, can have their device replaced for free by Apple. This issue does not affect the iPhone 8 Plus.[50][51]

List of iPhone models

The iPhone 11 is a smartphone developed and marketed by Apple Inc. It is the thirteenth generation of iPhone, succeeding the iPhone XR, and was unveiled on September 10, 2019, alongside the higher-end iPhone 11 Pro at the Steve Jobs Theater in Apple Park, Cupertino, by Apple CEO Tim Cook. Preorders began on September 13, 2019, and the phone was officially released on September 20, 2019, one day after the official public release of iOS 13.

Despite minimal exterior changes from the preceding iPhone XR, substantial design changes within the phone took place, including the addition of the more powerful Apple A13 Bionic chip as well as an ultra-wide dual-camera system.[9] In October 2020, Apple halted the inclusion of both Apple EarPods and the wall adapter, citing environmental goals.[10][11]

As of March 2022[update], the iPhone 11 has sold 159.2 million units worldwide, making it the tenth best-selling smartphone of all time.[12][13]

The iPhone 11 as well as the iPhone 12 mini and iPhone 13 Pro with its Max variant were discontinued and removed from Apple's website after the announcement of the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro on September 7, 2022.


History
--------------------------------------------------
Details regarding the smartphone were widely leaked before the official release; complete specifications and renderings of the phone were widely publicized. Among the most significant changes were improvements in the cameras and the continuation of the 'notch' design around the frontal camera which dipped down into the screen, a feature started by the iPhone X.[14][15][16] The official event invite which was sent out to developers contained a graphic featuring an Apple logo made of layered colored glass, implied to be the new colors for the phone. A patent filed by Apple earlier in the year also hinted at a new camera design.[17][18]


Design
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 11 was available in six colors: Purple, Yellow, Green, Black, White and Product (Red). The top of the screen retains the 'notch' design, wherein the TrueDepth camera system and phone speaker are encapsulated in a black, rounded-out rectangle that dips into the screen, similar to its predecessor, the iPhone XR. An elevated area in the top corner on the back of the iPhone acts as a camera housing, containing the microphone, the flashlight, and both of the rear-facing digital cameras.[11][19] The Apple logo on the back of the phone is centered to be equidistant to all edges and is made of a reflective material.


Specifications
--------------------------------------------------

Hardware
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 11, along with the iPhone 11 Pro, uses Apple's A13 Bionic processor, which contains a third-generation neural engine. It has three internal storage options: 64 GB, 128 GB, and 256 GB.[20] It also has 4 GB of RAM.[21] The iPhone 11 has an IP68 water- and dust-resistant rating along with dirt and grime, and is water-resistant up to 2 m (6.6 ft) for 30 minutes. However, the manufacturer's warranty does not cover liquid damage to the phone. Also, like previous iPhones, both phones do not have a headphone jack, and initially came with wired EarPods with a Lightning connector, although Apple no longer includes these with any device.[11][21] The iPhone 11 is the first smartphone with built-in ultra wideband hardware, via its Apple U1 chip.[22][23][24]


Display
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 11 has a 6.1-inch (15 cm) IPS LCD with a resolution of 1792 × 828 pixels (1.4 megapixels) at a pixel density of 326 PPI with a maximum brightness of 625 nits and a 1400:1 contrast ratio and it is equivalent to the iPhone XR. It supports Dolby Vision, HDR10, True-Tone, and a wide color gamut. As with the iPhone 11 Pro, XR, XS, and X, the display has a notch at the top for the TrueDepth camera system and the speaker. The display has an oleophobic coating, making it fingerprint-resistant.[2][21] Apple announced in September 2019 that both the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro would show a warning notification if a display were replaced with an unauthorized part. Apple stated that problems with the phone could arise if the wrong parts or procedures were used during the repair process.[25]


Battery
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 11 is supplied with a 11.91 Wh (3,110 mAh) battery, a slight increase from the 11.21 Wh (2,942 mAh) found in the iPhone XR. The battery is not user-replaceable.


Camera
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 11 includes a dual-lens 12 MP rear camera array. It has one ƒ/2.4 ultra-wide-angle lens with a 120° field of view and 2× optical zoom out, and one ƒ/1.8 wide-angle lens. The iPhone 11 supports 4K video at up to 60 fps and 1080p slow motion at up to 240 fps.[2] The phone also features an audio zoom feature, which focuses audio on the area on which is being zoomed in, similar to the Pro model.[21] Both of the cameras support video, although only the primary lens has OIS. It supports portrait mode with six portrait lighting effects, depth control, and an advanced bokeh effect. The phone also has an automatic night mode allowing the camera to take brighter pictures with reduced noise in low-light environments. Also, a redesigned camera app adds new features such as a scroll wheel for choosing between the different lenses and a feature called "QuickTake", which allows the user to long-press the shutter button to take a video. Apple has also announced a new Deep Fusion feature that takes advantage of AI and machine learning for image processing and was released via iOS 13.2 software update on October 29, 2019.[2][21][26]


Software
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 11 was supplied with iOS 13,[27] which includes Siri, Face ID (through the TrueDepth camera), Apple Pay, and Apple Card support. It received iOS 14 on September 16, 2020, iOS 15 on September 20, 2021, iOS 16 on September 12, 2022, iOS 17 on September 18, 2023.[28] and iOS 18 on September 16, 2024.[29]


Reception
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 11 drew generally positive reviews after its launch.[27][30] Reviews generally praised the phone's performance, battery life, and cameras, while criticizing the display as passable, but aging quickly. Reviewers also criticized the notch as being far too large for 2019. According to Counterpoint Research's Market Pulse, it was the second best-selling and the most popular model globally for 2019, in less than four months of launch.[31]


Controversy
--------------------------------------------------

Removal of the power adapter and EarPods
--------------------------------------------------
Apple, through an environmental initiative, has removed the EarPods and power adapter from new iPhone boxes starting October 2020, including the iPhone 11. Removing these items is claimed to reduce e-waste and permit a smaller iPhone box, allowing more devices to be transported simultaneously to decrease carbon footprint. However, Apple now includes a USB-C to Lightning cable, incompatible with the existing USB-A power adapters that Apple previously supplied with their devices. Upgraders can still use their existing iPhone power adapters and cables, but users wanting fast charging capabilities will have to purchase a USB-C power adapter separately.[32]

List of iPhone models

The iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Mini (stylized and marketed as iPhone 12 mini) are smartphones developed and marketed by Apple Inc. They are the fourteenth-generation iPhones, succeeding the iPhone 11.[19] They were unveiled at a virtually held Apple Special Event at Apple Park in Cupertino, California, on October 13, 2020, alongside the "premium flagship" iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max and HomePod Mini. Pre-orders for the iPhone 12 started on October 16, 2020, and the phone was released in most countries on October 23, 2020, alongside the iPhone 12 Pro and fourth-generation iPad Air. Pre-orders for the iPhone 12 Mini began on November 6, 2020, and the phone was released on November 13, 2020, alongside the iPhone 12 Pro Max.[20]

The major upgrades over the iPhone 11[21] include the addition of a Super Retina XDR OLED as opposed to the Liquid Retina LED-backlit LCD IPS panel on the iPhone 11 and XR, 5G support, the introduction of MagSafe, Apple A14 Bionic system on a chip (SoC) and high-dynamic-range video Dolby Vision 4K up to 30 fps.[22] The iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Mini, like the iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max, are the first iPhone models from Apple to no longer include a power adapter or EarPods headphones found in prior iPhone models; however, a USB-C to Lightning cable is included; this change was retroactively applied to other iPhone models sold by Apple, such as the iPhone XR, iPhone 11 and the second-generation iPhone SE.


Design
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 12 and 12 Mini is the first major redesign since the iPhone X. It features a chassis with flat edges, similar to the iPhone 4 and iPhone 5 designs, as well as the iPad Pro since 2018, and the 4th-generation iPad Air, which was also released in 2020. The notch size is similar to previous iPhone models, despite speculation about a reduction in width.[23] The borders around the display are thinner by 35% than any previous model. The new design also comes with a ceramic-hardened front glass, marketed as Ceramic Shield, while the back retains the previous generation Dual-Ion Exchange strengthened glass.[24]

On April 20, 2021, at Apple's Special Event “Spring Loaded”, Apple revealed a new purple color option which became available on April 30, 2021.[25]

The iPhone 12 and 12 Mini are available in six colors: Black, White, Product Red, Green, Blue, and Purple.[24]


Specifications
--------------------------------------------------

Hardware
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Mini use Apple's six-core A14 Bionic processor, which contains a next-generation neural engine. They both have three internal storage options: 64, 128, and 256 GB.[a] Both also carry an IP68 water and dust resistance rating along with dirt and grime, and is water-resistant up to six meters (20 feet) for 30 minutes. However, the manufacturer warranty does not cover liquid damage to the phone.

The iPhone 12 series are the first iPhone models to be supplied from launch without EarPods or a wall adapter, which Apple says was done to reduce carbon emissions and waste since most users already own them. Apple also claims 70% more boxes can fit on a pallet given the smaller box, and thus further reducing emissions.[26] A USB-C to Lightning cord is still included. This change also applies retroactively to all other iPhone models still in production.[27] To comply with French law regarding wireless device radiation and health which requires phones to be bundled with and promote use of hands-free accessories by children under 14, iPhone models will still include EarPods in this market.[28]

A magnetic connector known as MagSafe is introduced on the iPhone 12 models, allowing accessories such as cases and charging cords to be attached to the rear of the device. Accessories can also be stacked together.[29]

The devices support 5G cellular communications. This allows upload speeds of up to 200 Mbit/s and download speeds of up to 4 Gbit/s.[30] However, only models sold in the U.S. support the fastest mmWave technology; those sold elsewhere in the world, including Canada, support only sub-6 GHz frequency bands.[31] A new feature called Smart Data Mode enables 5G only when necessary to preserve battery life.[32]


Displays
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 12 features a 6.1-inch (155 mm) display[33] with Super Retina XDR OLED technology at a resolution of 2532 × 1170 pixels and a pixel density of about 460 ppi.[34] The iPhone 12 Mini features a 5.4-inch (137 mm) display with the same technology at a resolution of 2340 × 1080 pixels, and a pixel density of about 476 ppi. Both phones have a peak brightness of 1200 nits when viewing HDR content equivalent to the iPhone 12 Pro, and normal brightness of 625 nits.[34] Both phones also use an improved glass-ceramic covering called Ceramic Shield which is co-developed with Corning Inc. Apple describes it as having "4 times better drop performance" and being "tougher than any smartphone glass".[35]


Batteries
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 12 has a 10.78 Wh (2,815 mAh) battery, a slight decrease from the 11.91 Wh (3,110 mAh) battery found in the iPhone 11 and identical to the battery found in the iPhone 12 Pro. The iPhone 12 Mini has a 8.57 Wh (2,227 mAh) battery. Like previous iPhones, the battery is not user-replaceable.[36]


Chipsets
--------------------------------------------------
Both the iPhone 12 and 12 Mini have the Apple A14 Bionic, the first ARM-based smartphone system-on-a-chip (SoC) manufactured on the 5 nm process node. However, unlike previous years, they are not the first Apple devices to receive the newest A-series processor, with the fourth-generation iPad Air being the first. Both phones use Qualcomm's Snapdragon X55 5G modem.


Cameras
--------------------------------------------------
Both phones have two rear 12-megapixel cameras: wide and ultra-wide. The wide camera is a 26 mm full-frame equivalent with an f/1.6 aperture which captures 27% more light than the f/1.8 aperture in the iPhone 11[20] and a seven-element lens. The ultra-wide camera is a 13 mm full-frame equivalent with an f/2.4 aperture and a five-element lens.[37]

All cameras now support Night Mode for both photo and time-lapse video at full resolution.[24] Smart HDR has been improved thanks to Smart HDR 3.[37] This iPhone model is the first capable of shooting 10-bit high dynamic range Dolby Vision 4K video at up to 30 fps which allows for greater brightness and deeper shadows.[38]

The front-facing, TrueDepth camera features a 12-megapixel camera with an f/2.2 aperture. This model also added Night Mode to the front-facing camera.[24]

Sensors

The iPhone 12 and 12 Mini include mostly the same sensors found on prior iPhone models going back to the iPhone X. These include an accelerometer, gyroscope, barometer, proximity sensor, ambient light sensor, and a digital compass. The devices also include the Face ID sensor for biometric authentication.


Software
--------------------------------------------------
Both phones originally shipped with iOS 14.[24] The devices come with the stock iOS apps, such as Safari, Weather, and Messages, and they include Siri, the personal assistant in iOS. They received iOS 15 on September 20, 2021, iOS 16 on September 12, 2022, iOS 17 on September 18, 2023, and most recently, iOS 18 on September 16, 2024.[39]


Reception
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 12 received largely positive reviews. The Verge called it a "beautiful, powerful, and incredibly capable device", praising the new design reminiscent of the iPhone 5, the speed of the A14 Bionic processor, its 5G capabilities, addition of the OLED display like on the high end iPhones, combined with much slimmer bezels than previous iPhone models and improved battery life over iPhone 11.[40] Engadget also gave the iPhone 12 a positive review, praising the MagSafe wireless charging and accessories magnetic attachment as well as the redesigned camera system, a greatly improved display like in its Pro counterparts.[41]

iPhone 12 was the third best-selling and was the most popular model globally in Q2 2021.[42]

Apple was criticized for the continued reliance on Face ID as the sole biometric option to unlock the device, which is incompatible with face masks. iOS 14.5 allowed the use of a paired Apple Watch to unlock the phone while wearing a mask, while iOS 15.4 allows unlocking with a mask on, without an Apple Watch. The third-generation iPhone SE is the only iPhone currently produced by Apple that supports Touch ID, an alternative unlocking option that is compatible with face masks. All models can still use a passcode to log in.[43][44][45][46]

The iPhone 12 mini has received more mixed reviews. Some praised the phone for being a new small phone, while others criticized the price and inferior battery life compared to the full-size 12[47] (although the battery life of the iPhone 12 mini is longer than that of the second-generation iPhone SE[48]).


"OLED-gate"
--------------------------------------------------
Within two weeks after its public release, a thread was started at Apple Support Communities describing a problem with the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro OLED panel black pixels not shutting off completely in black scenes, resulting in what was described as "ugly glowing".[49] A considerable number of users have since posted replies reporting the same problem, photos and videos have been shared online demonstrating the issue. As of January 2021, Apple has not yet made an official statement.


EarPods and power adapter controversy
--------------------------------------------------
Apple no longer includes either EarPods or a power adapter in the boxes of all iPhone 12 and 12 Pro models, claiming that it is an environmental initiative and no longer including them would reduce e-waste and permit smaller iPhone boxes, allowing more devices to be transported simultaneously to decrease its carbon footprint. The boxes only include a USB-C to Lightning cable, incompatible with the existing USB-A power adapters that Apple previously supplied with its devices. Users can still use their existing USB-A power adapters and cables but must purchase a USB-C power adapter sold separately to enable fast charging.

The iPhone 12 was sold in France with EarPods as the law required that smartphones be bundled with “hands-free kits” or a “headset” in order to protect children aged 14 and younger from electromagnetic radiation.[50][51]

In December 2020, a Brazilian consumer rights watchdog Procon-SP Foundation requested Apple to provide proof that not including chargers is beneficial to the environment. The watchdog argues that Apple removing the charger is harming consumers and wants to force the company to include one as it claims the charger is an essential component.[52]

The Verge reported the reason power adapters and EarPods are no longer included could be to offset the increased cost of 5G components. These new components are reported to cost 30% more than their predecessors.[53]


Repairability concerns
--------------------------------------------------
iFixit and Australian YouTuber Hugh Jeffreys discovered that a number of key components such as the cameras would malfunction or display warnings if they are replaced with new ones or those taken from an otherwise identical donor unit.[54] Internal Apple documents also mention that, beginning with the iPhone 12 and in subsequent models, authorized technicians would have to run the phones through an internal System Configuration tool to reprogram repaired units in order to account for hardware changes. While Apple has yet to comment on the issue, the inability to replace key system components have raised concerns about right to repair and planned obsolescence.[55] However, the iPhone 12 Mini does not have this issue.[56] Apple later addressed the issue with the release of iOS 14.4, which displays a warning message if the phone detects an unpaired camera module but otherwise allows for full functionality.[57]


Electromagnetic radiation concerns
--------------------------------------------------
In September 2023, the French watchdog agency Agence nationale des fréquences [fr] notified Apple that sales of the iPhone 12 must be halted in France due to the device exceeding the legal specific absorption rate for consumer electronics. The agency also requested that Apple must recall all iPhone 12s that have been produced in order to meet safety regulations. However, this coincided with the release of the iPhone 15 models where Apple also discontinued the iPhone 12 globally.[58]

Despite the move however, France's digital minister did emphasize the iPhone 12's radiation levels[59] remained well below the threshold deemed harmful by scientific studies. Even Apple, "...disputed the findings and said the device complies with regulations..." [Regulations | source 39]. This highlighted a discrepancy between the agency's tests and real-world phone usage scenarios.[60]

List of iPhone models

The iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini (stylized as iPhone 13 mini) are smartphones developed and marketed by Apple. They are the fifteenth generation of iPhones, succeeding the iPhone 12 and 12 Mini. They were unveiled at an Apple Event in Apple Park in Cupertino, California, on September 14, 2021, alongside the higher-priced iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max flagships. They were released on September 24, 2021.[12][13]

The iPhone 13 Mini was discontinued in September 2023, and the iPhone 13 was discontinued in September 2024 with the announcement of the iPhone 16.


History
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini were officially announced alongside the ninth-generation iPad, 6th generation iPad Mini, Apple Watch Series 7, iPhone 13 Pro, and iPhone 13 Pro Max by a virtual press event filmed and recorded at Apple Park in Cupertino, California, on September 14, 2021. Pre-orders began on September 17, 2021, at 5:00 am PDT. Pricing starts at US$799 for the iPhone 13 and US$699 for the iPhone 13 Mini.[14]

Together with iPhone 12, the iPhone 13 Mini was discontinued on September 12, 2023, with the announcement of the iPhone 15 and 15 Pro. The iPhone 13 continues to be sold until the announcement of the iPhone 16 and 16 Pro on September 9, 2024, when it was discontinued alongside the iPhone 15 Pro.


Design
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 13 has a flat chassis analogous to that of contemporaneous Apple products with some differences such as the rear cameras being larger and arranged diagonally. The Face ID True Depth sensor housing on the iPhone is 20% smaller yet taller than its predecessors.[15]

The iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini are available in six colors: Midnight, Starlight, Product Red, Blue, Pink, and Green.[16][17]

On March 8, 2022, at Apple's Special Event "Peek Performance", Apple revealed a new Green color option, which became available and released on March 18, 2022. [16][17]


Specifications
--------------------------------------------------

Hardware
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini use an Apple-designed A15 Bionic system on a chip. The iPhone 13 and 13 Mini feature a 6-core CPU, 4-core GPU, and 16-core Neural Engine, while the iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max feature a 5-core GPU.[18]


Display
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 13 features a 6.1-inch (155 mm) display with Super Retina XDR OLED technology at a resolution of 2532×1170 pixels and a pixel density of about 460 PPI with a refresh rate of 60 Hz. The iPhone 13 Mini features a 5.4-inch (137 mm) display with the same technology at a resolution of 2340×1080 pixels and a pixel density of about 476 PPI. Both models have the Super Retina XDR OLED display with improved typical brightness up to 800 nits, and max brightness up to 1200 nits.[19]


Cameras
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 13 and 13 Mini feature the same camera system with three cameras: one front-facing camera (12MP f/2.2) and two back-facing cameras: a wide (12MP f/1.6) and ultra-wide (12MP f/2.4) camera. The back-facing cameras both contain larger sensors for more light-gathering with new sensor shift optical image stabilization (OIS) on the main camera. The camera module on the back is arranged diagonally instead of vertically to engineer the larger sensors.[3]

The cameras use Apple's latest computational photography engine, called Smart HDR 4. Users can also choose from a range of photographic styles during capture, including rich contrast, vibrant, warm, and cool. Apple clarifies this is different from a filter because it works intelligently with the image processing algorithm during capture to apply local adjustments to an image and the effects will be baked into the photos, unlike filters which can be removed after applying.[3]

The camera app contains a new mode called Cinematic Mode, which allows users to rack focus between subjects and create (simulate) shallow depth of field using software algorithms. It is supported on wide and front-facing cameras in 1080p at 30 fps.[3]


Charging
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 13 and 13 Mini have Lightning fast charging at 20 Watts, and wireless charging via MagSafe at 15 W (iPhone 13) or 12 W (13 Mini), or via the Qi protocol at 7.5 W.


Software
--------------------------------------------------
iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini were originally shipped with iOS 15 at launch.[20] They are compatible with iOS 16, which was released on September 12, 2022. The latest software iOS 17, which was revealed at Apple's WWDC 2023 event, is compatible with the iPhone 13 and 13 Mini.[21] The next-generation Qi2 wireless charging standard has been added to the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini with the update to iOS 17.2.[22] It is compatible with iOS 18, which was released on September 16, 2024.[23]

The 13 and 13 Mini are able to make calls via: FaceTime Audio / Video (not available in some regions); Voice over LTE (VoLTE); Wi-Fi Calling (not available in some regions models). Wi-Fi hotspotting is also possible


Repairability
--------------------------------------------------
Some iPhone 13 parts are paired to the motherboard. The user is warned if a paired component (e.g. screen, battery) is replaced by independent repair shops, and the Face ID sensors may completely cease to function if replaced. On later iOS versions Apple removed this limitation. Apple technicians have a proprietary software tool to pair components.[24][25]

List of iPhone models

The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus are smartphones developed and marketed by Apple Inc. They are the sixteenth-generation iPhones, succeeding the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini, and were announced during Apple Event, Apple Park in Cupertino, California, on September 7, 2022, alongside the higher-priced iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max flagships. The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus feature a 6.1-inch (15 cm) and 6.7-inch (17 cm) display, improvements to the rear-facing camera, and satellite connectivity for contacting emergency services when a user in trouble is beyond the range of Wi-Fi or cellular networks.[11][12] The iPhone 14 was made available on September 16, 2022,[13] and iPhone 14 Plus was made available on October 7, 2022, priced at $799 and $899 respectively and was launched with iOS 16.[8][14] Pre-orders for the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus began on September 9, 2022.[15] Along with the 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max, the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus are the last iPhones to feature the Lightning port, as their successors, the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus (announced on September 12, 2023), use a USB-C port instead, per European Commission regulation.[16][17]

The iPhone 14 does not have a "Mini" version like its predecessor, the iPhone 13. Instead, Apple returned to a larger model with the iPhone 14 Plus. Apple had not introduced a "Plus" model iPhone since the iPhone 8 Plus in 2017. Both iPhone 14 models (as well as iPhone 14 Pro models) sold in the United States, ended support for physical SIM cards, making them the first iPhone models since the CDMA variant of the iPhone 4 to not come with a discrete SIM card reader, requiring activation by way of eSIM.[18] With Apple retiring the iPhone 13 in September 2024, the iPhone 14 is currently the oldest iPhone model still fully supported and sold by Apple.


History
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 14 was originally rumored to come with 6.1-inch and 5.4-inch display size options. However, when the iPhone 14 was unveiled, no smaller display option was available. This may have been due to underwhelming sales of the iPhone 12 Mini and iPhone 13 Mini. Instead, a larger 6.7-inch display size option was added to the lower-priced iPhone 14 lineup.[19][20] The new 6.7-inch variant of the iPhone 14 was named "iPhone 14 Plus", rather than "iPhone 14 Max", which was predicted by previous rumors.[21][22]

The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus were officially announced at Apple's "Far Out" event, along with the iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 14 Pro Max, Apple Watch Series 8, Apple Watch SE (2nd generation), Apple Watch Ultra, AirPods Pro (2nd generation) and an update to Apple Fitness+ via a virtual press conference filmed at Apple Park in Cupertino, California on September 7, 2022.[23][24]

Apple started taking pre-orders on September 9, with general availability from September 16 for the iPhone 14 and October 7 for the iPhone 14 Plus.[25]


Design
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus have an identical design to the iPhone 13, although the US models do not have a physical SIM tray.

The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus are available in six colors: Blue, Purple, Midnight, Starlight, Yellow, and Product Red.[27] Purple is a new color replacing Pink used on the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini. The yellow colour option was added on March 7, 2023.[28]


Hardware
--------------------------------------------------
iPhone 14 and 14 Plus are available in three internal storage configurations: 128, 256, and 512 GB. Both models have 6 GB of RAM, an increase over the previous iPhone 13 and 13 mini models' 4 GB of RAM. The iPhone 14 and 14 Plus have the same IP68 rating for dust and water resistance as their predecessors.[7]


Chipset
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 14 and 14 Plus use a 5-nanometer Apple-designed SOC, the A15 Bionic, while the iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max have a newer A16 Bionic.[29][30]

The iPhone 14's A15 chip has a 6-core CPU, 5-core GPU, and a 16-core Neural Engine. It is identical to the A15 in the previous year's iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max,[29][30] which has more memory and an additional GPU core compared to the A15 in the non-Pro iPhone 13 models.[31][32]

The iPhone 14 was the first flagship model since the 2008 iPhone 3G, whose chip was unchanged from the previous year.[29] The Verge's Mitchell Clark attributed the unchanged chip to an attempt to maintain costs during the ongoing chip shortage and inflation surge. Clark also said the A15 "still outperforms the latest chips from Qualcomm and Google in most benchmarks", though the older chip may lead to the iPhone 14 receiving fewer updates, similar to what happened with the iPhone 5C from 2013.[29][30]


Display
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 14 features a 6.1-inch (155 mm) display with Super Retina XDR OLED technology at a resolution of 2532 × 1170 pixels and a pixel density of about 460 PPI with a refresh rate of 60 Hz. The iPhone 14 Plus features a 6.7-inch (170 mm) display with the same technology at a resolution of 2778 × 1284 pixels and a pixel density of around 458 PPI. Both models have typical brightness of up to 800 nits, and a max brightness of up to 1200 nits.[7]


Cameras
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 14 and 14 Plus feature the same camera system with two cameras: one front-facing camera (12MP f/1.9), and two back-facing cameras: a wide (12MP f/1.5) and ultra-wide (12MP f/2.4) camera, with the wide and front-facing cameras having a faster aperture than the iPhone 13. The front-facing camera also has autofocus for the first time.[33]

The cameras use Apple's latest computational photography engine, called Smart HDR 4. Users can also choose from a range of photographic styles during capture, including rich contrast, vibrant, warm, and cool. Apple clarifies this is different from a filter because it works intelligently with the image processing algorithm during capture to apply local adjustments to an image, and the effects will be baked into the photos, unlike filters which can be removed after applying.[7]

The camera app contains Cinematic Mode, which allows users to rack focus between subjects and create (simulate) shallow depth of field using software algorithms. It is supported on wide and front-facing cameras in 4K at 30 fps and 60 fps.[7]

An "Action mode" feature was added to extend the electrical video stabilization. When activated, a smaller crop of the image sensor is read out for video recording. While reducing the field of view, a wider area around it can be used as buffer against shakes. The area read out from the image sensor is moved between frames to counteract hand movements.[34]


Battery
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 14 is equipped with slightly longer battery life compared to the iPhone 13. According to Apple, the iPhone 14 (3,279 mAh) can provide up to 20 hours of video playback,[35] 16 hours of streaming video playback, and 80 hours of audio playback. Its predecessor, the iPhone 13 (3,240 mAh), is rated for up to 19 hours of video playback, 15 hours of streaming video playback, and 75 hours of audio playback. The larger iPhone 14 Plus (4,325 mAh) variant provides up to 26 hours of video playback.[36]


Software
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 14 and 14 Plus originally shipped with iOS 16. The next-generation Qi2 wireless charging standard was added to the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus with the update to iOS 17.2.[37] The latest version of iOS, iOS 18, which was revealed at Apple's WWDC 2024 event, was released to the public on September 16, 2024, and is compatible with the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus.

Satellite connectivity
--------------------------------------------------
Apple's new Emergency SOS via satellite service for iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro models uses the spectrum in L and S bands designated for mobile satellite services by ITU Radio Regulations. When an iPhone user makes an Emergency SOS via satellite request, the message is received by an orbiting satellite operated by Globalstar. The satellite then sends the message down to ground stations located across the globe.[11]

As of November 2022, Globalstar operates a constellation of 25 satellites in low Earth orbit, with plans to enhance this in the future via its partnership with Apple.[11][42]

The service became available to US and Canada on November 15, 2022, and to the UK, Germany, Ireland, and France on December 13, 2022.[43] From May 15, 2023 the service became available in Australia and New Zealand.[44]


Criticism
--------------------------------------------------

Crash Detection false positives
--------------------------------------------------
Crash Detection is a feature built into the iPhone 14 that is designed to detect severe car crashes and automatically initiates an emergency phone call 20 seconds after it is detected unless the user cancels it.[45] Since its release, there have been many reports saying that the feature was automatically turned on during rollercoaster rides, due to the fact that the rides suddenly stop after going at high speeds, acting the same way a car crash does.[46][47]

Emergency dispatchers have received many false alarm calls from iPhone 14 and Apple Watch users who have been skiing safely. In Colorado, a wave of false 9-1-1 calls led Aspen Mountain to advise device owners to upgrade their operating systems or disable the feature.[48] In Japan's Hida Mountains, emergency dispatchers reported 134 false emergency calls, more than 14% of the total emergency call volume, between December 16, 2022, and January 23, 2023, attributed to Crash Detection triggering while an iPhone 14 owner was skiing.[49]


Repairability
--------------------------------------------------
While the iPhone 14 was originally lauded for its innovative new hardware design and recommended by iFixit, concerns over software limitations on parts not authorized by Apple caused iFixit to decrease their evaluation to a 4/10 or "not recommended" in September 2023.[50][51]

List of iPhone models

The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are smartphones developed and marketed by Apple. They are the seventeenth generation of iPhones, succeeding the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus. The devices were announced on September 12, 2023, during the Apple Event at Apple Park in Cupertino, California alongside the higher-priced iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max. Pre-orders began on September 15, 2023, and the devices were made available on September 22, 2023. Like the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, the 15 and 15 Plus are the first iPhones to replace the proprietary Lightning connector with USB-C to comply with European Union mandates.


History
--------------------------------------------------
In September 2021, the European Commission began considering a proposal to mandate USB-C on all devices in the European Union, including iPhones.[10] Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo claimed that Apple would drop its proprietary Lightning connector by 2023. At the time of those claims, Apple was considering switching to USB-C due to the likelihood that the EU proposal would pass.[11] The proposal was passed into law in October 2022, becoming the Radio Equipment Directive. Apple confirmed it would comply with the regulations later that month.[12]

Two weeks prior to the formal introduction of the iPhone 15, it was announced that some of the devices which were made in India would for the first time be sold around the world on the launch day.[13]


Design
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 15 is the first major redesign since the iPhone 12, featuring rounder edges and a slightly curved display, and back glass. Both models are available in five colors: blue, pink, yellow, green and black.[1] This makes it the first entry level iPhone since the iPhone XR to not ship with a Product Red variant at launch.


Hardware
--------------------------------------------------

Display
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 15 features a 6.1-inch (155 mm) display with Super Retina XDR OLED technology at a resolution of 2556×1179 pixels and a pixel density of about 460 PPI with a refresh rate of 60 Hz. The iPhone 15 Plus features a 6.7-inch (170 mm) display with the same technology at a resolution of 2796×1290 pixels and a pixel density of about 460 PPI. Both models have an improved typical brightness of up to 1,000 nits, a peak HDR brightness of up to 1,600 nits, and a peak outdoor brightness of up to 2,000 nits.[9] The Dynamic Island feature, previously exclusive to iPhone 14 Pro, is now standard on iPhone 15, replacing the notch that was introduced in the iPhone X.[14]


Charging and transfer speeds
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus use USB-C with USB 2.0 transfer speeds (up to 480 Mb/s or 60 MB/s),[15] compared to the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max which have faster USB 3.2 Gen 2 transfer speeds (up to 10 Gb/s or 1.25 GB/s).[16] The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus, as well as the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, are the first iPhone models to use USB-C, as well as the first iPhones since the iPhone 5 to switch to a new charging port.


Video output
--------------------------------------------------
All iPhone 15 models have support for DisplayPort Alternate Mode over USB-C video output with HDR up to 4K resolution.[9]

Previous iPhone models (from iPhone 5 until iPhone 14) had a maximum supported resolution of 1600 x 900 (slightly less than 1080p) with the Lightning Digital AV Adapter due to technical constraints of the Lightning connector.[17]


Battery
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 15 Plus offers users up to 26 hours of video playback and up to 100 hours of audio playback, and the iPhone 15 offers significantly less, with up to 20 hours of video playback and up to 80 hours of audio playback.[18]


Software
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus launched with iOS 17 and is compatible with iOS 18.[19][20][21] Consistent with the UK Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure regulation, it will continue to receive major software updates for a minimum of five years to at least 2028.[22]


Specifications
--------------------------------------------------
6.33 by 3.06 in (161 by 78 mm)

Criticism
--------------------------------------------------

Overheating
--------------------------------------------------
Some owners claimed that their iPhone 15s were experiencing overheating issues,[26] reportedly reaching temperatures as high as 47 °C (117 °F).[27] Apple later stated that there were several reasons why the phones heat up, mainly hinting at a software issue.[28] It was stated that it would be fixed with an update to iOS 17.0.3.[29] The overheating issues were reported to persist after the update.[30]

List of iPhone models

The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus are smartphones developed and marketed by Apple Inc. They are the sixteenth-generation iPhones, succeeding the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini, and were announced during Apple Event, Apple Park in Cupertino, California, on September 7, 2022, alongside the higher-priced iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max flagships. The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus feature a 6.1-inch (15 cm) and 6.7-inch (17 cm) display, improvements to the rear-facing camera, and satellite connectivity for contacting emergency services when a user in trouble is beyond the range of Wi-Fi or cellular networks.[11][12] The iPhone 14 was made available on September 16, 2022,[13] and iPhone 14 Plus was made available on October 7, 2022, priced at $799 and $899 respectively and was launched with iOS 16.[8][14] Pre-orders for the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus began on September 9, 2022.[15] Along with the 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max, the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus are the last iPhones to feature the Lightning port, as their successors, the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus (announced on September 12, 2023), use a USB-C port instead, per European Commission regulation.[16][17]

The iPhone 14 does not have a "Mini" version like its predecessor, the iPhone 13. Instead, Apple returned to a larger model with the iPhone 14 Plus. Apple had not introduced a "Plus" model iPhone since the iPhone 8 Plus in 2017. Both iPhone 14 models (as well as iPhone 14 Pro models) sold in the United States, ended support for physical SIM cards, making them the first iPhone models since the CDMA variant of the iPhone 4 to not come with a discrete SIM card reader, requiring activation by way of eSIM.[18] With Apple retiring the iPhone 13 in September 2024, the iPhone 14 is currently the oldest iPhone model still fully supported and sold by Apple.


History
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 14 was originally rumored to come with 6.1-inch and 5.4-inch display size options. However, when the iPhone 14 was unveiled, no smaller display option was available. This may have been due to underwhelming sales of the iPhone 12 Mini and iPhone 13 Mini. Instead, a larger 6.7-inch display size option was added to the lower-priced iPhone 14 lineup.[19][20] The new 6.7-inch variant of the iPhone 14 was named "iPhone 14 Plus", rather than "iPhone 14 Max", which was predicted by previous rumors.[21][22]

The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus were officially announced at Apple's "Far Out" event, along with the iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 14 Pro Max, Apple Watch Series 8, Apple Watch SE (2nd generation), Apple Watch Ultra, AirPods Pro (2nd generation) and an update to Apple Fitness+ via a virtual press conference filmed at Apple Park in Cupertino, California on September 7, 2022.[23][24]

Apple started taking pre-orders on September 9, with general availability from September 16 for the iPhone 14 and October 7 for the iPhone 14 Plus.[25]


Design
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus have an identical design to the iPhone 13, although the US models do not have a physical SIM tray.

The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus are available in six colors: Blue, Purple, Midnight, Starlight, Yellow, and Product Red.[27] Purple is a new color replacing Pink used on the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini. The yellow colour option was added on March 7, 2023.[28]


Hardware
--------------------------------------------------
iPhone 14 and 14 Plus are available in three internal storage configurations: 128, 256, and 512 GB. Both models have 6 GB of RAM, an increase over the previous iPhone 13 and 13 mini models' 4 GB of RAM. The iPhone 14 and 14 Plus have the same IP68 rating for dust and water resistance as their predecessors.[7]


Chipset
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 14 and 14 Plus use a 5-nanometer Apple-designed SOC, the A15 Bionic, while the iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max have a newer A16 Bionic.[29][30]

The iPhone 14's A15 chip has a 6-core CPU, 5-core GPU, and a 16-core Neural Engine. It is identical to the A15 in the previous year's iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max,[29][30] which has more memory and an additional GPU core compared to the A15 in the non-Pro iPhone 13 models.[31][32]

The iPhone 14 was the first flagship model since the 2008 iPhone 3G, whose chip was unchanged from the previous year.[29] The Verge's Mitchell Clark attributed the unchanged chip to an attempt to maintain costs during the ongoing chip shortage and inflation surge. Clark also said the A15 "still outperforms the latest chips from Qualcomm and Google in most benchmarks", though the older chip may lead to the iPhone 14 receiving fewer updates, similar to what happened with the iPhone 5C from 2013.[29][30]


Display
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 14 features a 6.1-inch (155 mm) display with Super Retina XDR OLED technology at a resolution of 2532 × 1170 pixels and a pixel density of about 460 PPI with a refresh rate of 60 Hz. The iPhone 14 Plus features a 6.7-inch (170 mm) display with the same technology at a resolution of 2778 × 1284 pixels and a pixel density of around 458 PPI. Both models have typical brightness of up to 800 nits, and a max brightness of up to 1200 nits.[7]


Cameras
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 14 and 14 Plus feature the same camera system with two cameras: one front-facing camera (12MP f/1.9), and two back-facing cameras: a wide (12MP f/1.5) and ultra-wide (12MP f/2.4) camera, with the wide and front-facing cameras having a faster aperture than the iPhone 13. The front-facing camera also has autofocus for the first time.[33]

The cameras use Apple's latest computational photography engine, called Smart HDR 4. Users can also choose from a range of photographic styles during capture, including rich contrast, vibrant, warm, and cool. Apple clarifies this is different from a filter because it works intelligently with the image processing algorithm during capture to apply local adjustments to an image, and the effects will be baked into the photos, unlike filters which can be removed after applying.[7]

The camera app contains Cinematic Mode, which allows users to rack focus between subjects and create (simulate) shallow depth of field using software algorithms. It is supported on wide and front-facing cameras in 4K at 30 fps and 60 fps.[7]

An "Action mode" feature was added to extend the electrical video stabilization. When activated, a smaller crop of the image sensor is read out for video recording. While reducing the field of view, a wider area around it can be used as buffer against shakes. The area read out from the image sensor is moved between frames to counteract hand movements.[34]


Battery
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 14 is equipped with slightly longer battery life compared to the iPhone 13. According to Apple, the iPhone 14 (3,279 mAh) can provide up to 20 hours of video playback,[35] 16 hours of streaming video playback, and 80 hours of audio playback. Its predecessor, the iPhone 13 (3,240 mAh), is rated for up to 19 hours of video playback, 15 hours of streaming video playback, and 75 hours of audio playback. The larger iPhone 14 Plus (4,325 mAh) variant provides up to 26 hours of video playback.[36]


Software
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 14 and 14 Plus originally shipped with iOS 16. The next-generation Qi2 wireless charging standard was added to the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus with the update to iOS 17.2.[37] The latest version of iOS, iOS 18, which was revealed at Apple's WWDC 2024 event, was released to the public on September 16, 2024, and is compatible with the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus.

Satellite connectivity
--------------------------------------------------
Apple's new Emergency SOS via satellite service for iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro models uses the spectrum in L and S bands designated for mobile satellite services by ITU Radio Regulations. When an iPhone user makes an Emergency SOS via satellite request, the message is received by an orbiting satellite operated by Globalstar. The satellite then sends the message down to ground stations located across the globe.[11]

As of November 2022, Globalstar operates a constellation of 25 satellites in low Earth orbit, with plans to enhance this in the future via its partnership with Apple.[11][42]

The service became available to US and Canada on November 15, 2022, and to the UK, Germany, Ireland, and France on December 13, 2022.[43] From May 15, 2023 the service became available in Australia and New Zealand.[44]


Criticism
--------------------------------------------------

Crash Detection false positives
--------------------------------------------------
Crash Detection is a feature built into the iPhone 14 that is designed to detect severe car crashes and automatically initiates an emergency phone call 20 seconds after it is detected unless the user cancels it.[45] Since its release, there have been many reports saying that the feature was automatically turned on during rollercoaster rides, due to the fact that the rides suddenly stop after going at high speeds, acting the same way a car crash does.[46][47]

Emergency dispatchers have received many false alarm calls from iPhone 14 and Apple Watch users who have been skiing safely. In Colorado, a wave of false 9-1-1 calls led Aspen Mountain to advise device owners to upgrade their operating systems or disable the feature.[48] In Japan's Hida Mountains, emergency dispatchers reported 134 false emergency calls, more than 14% of the total emergency call volume, between December 16, 2022, and January 23, 2023, attributed to Crash Detection triggering while an iPhone 14 owner was skiing.[49]


Repairability
--------------------------------------------------
While the iPhone 14 was originally lauded for its innovative new hardware design and recommended by iFixit, concerns over software limitations on parts not authorized by Apple caused iFixit to decrease their evaluation to a 4/10 or "not recommended" in September 2023.[50][51]

List of iPhone models

The iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus are smartphones developed and marketed by Apple. They are the eighteenth-generation iPhones, succeeding the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus, and those phones succeed the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus. The devices were unveiled alongside the higher-priced iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max during the September 9, 2024 Apple Event at Apple Park in Cupertino, California.[3] These lower-end phones come with the software update iOS 18, with more updates to come later in the future.


History
--------------------------------------------------
When Apple announced in "It's Glowtime" Event, The SiP chip of the lower-priced iPhone 16 lineup have skipped from the Apple A17 Pro (used in the iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max and iPad Mini 7th generation) to the regular Apple A18 (a low-entry variant 5-core GPU successor to the Apple A16 Bionic used in the iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 14 Pro Max, iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus) which this SiP is the first Apple A-series SiP in the iPhone to come with the two variants including the low-entry Apple A18 (a 5-core GPU variant, used in the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus) and the high-end Apple A18 Pro (a 6-core GPU variant, used in the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max).

The devices were unveiled during an event on September 9, 2024, marking the first time an iPhone release had been announced on a Monday.[4] It is also the first iPhone to not come included with Apple stickers, as Apple removed it for "environmental reasons", but the stickers can be included if a customer asks for it at an Apple Store.[5]


Design
--------------------------------------------------
Like the iPhone 15, the device features rounded edges, a slightly curved display, and back glass.


Display
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus retain their screen sizes of 6.1 inches and 6.7 inches, respectively. They feature a full-edge screen design with slim borders.


Camera
--------------------------------------------------
iPhone 16 features a more refined dual-lens array on the back, with a 48 megapixel Fusion wide-angle lens and 12 megapixel ultra-wide lens. The cameras are now aligned vertically, similar to iPhone 12, instead of diagonally like on iPhone 15, enabling spatial video capture.

There is also an improved Photographic Styles feature for real-time lighting and color adjustments, allowing specific tones and colors to be manipulated. [6]


Colors
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 16 and 16 Plus come in five colors: ultramarine, teal, pink, white and black.[7]


Hardware
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 16 and the iPhone 16 Plus use an Apple A18 system on a chip. The chip is optimized for running Generative artificial intelligence and features a Neural Engine that is twice as fast as its predecessor.

The iPhone 16 includes an updated 48-megapixel Fusion camera, the same resolution as the iPhone 15, with 2 μm, quad pixel PDAF, sensor-shift OIS, 100% Focus Pixels, support for super-high-resolution photos (24MP and 48MP). It has a new ultrawide camera with a wider aperture, automatic focus and 1.4 μm, 100% Focus Pixels.[8]

All ‌iPhone 16‌ models have an improved thermal design. The main logic board has been updated, centralizing chip placement and optimizing the surrounding architecture. The recycled aluminum substructure dissipates heat for up to 30 percent higher sustained performance for gaming.[9]

Every model in the iPhone 16 lineup has support for WiFi 7.[10]


Action Button
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus come with the Action Button, first featured on the iPhone 15 Pro lineup. By default, the Action Button toggles silent mode. However, users can change the button's feature to do different things other than silent mode, like open the Camera app or toggle a focus mode.


Camera Control button
--------------------------------------------------
All iPhone 16 models now come with a new button called Camera Control. This button is on the right side of the device, and allows the user to open the camera app, switch between different camera controls and features, and taking photos and videos. The button can distinguish between light and hard presses. By pressing the button once, it opens the camera app. By lightly pressing it twice, it opens a small menu with different camera controls, such as zoom or tone. Pressing the button hard once takes a photo, while holding for a few seconds starts a video. [11]


Battery and charging
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 16 has been upgraded in terms of battery capacity.[12]

The base iPhone 16 has video playback duration of up to 22 hours, while the iPhone 16 Plus has video playback up to 27 hours. The iPhone 16 has duration of audio playback up to 80 hours, 20% less than the iPhone 16 Plus with 100 hours of audio playback. The MagSafe wireless charging standard has been refreshed with a longer cable as an option, allowing the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus to charge at a faster speed of 25W with a 30W power adapter.


Enclosure
--------------------------------------------------
The enclosure is made up of 85% recycled content.[8]


Software
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 16 launched with iOS 18. While the device was announced alongside Apple Intelligence, these features were delayed until after release.[13]

iOS 18 includes RecoveryOS on the iPhone 16 series that allows users to recover and restore firmware wirelessly using another iPhone.[14]


Specifications
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 16 and 16 Plus have a vertical camera layout, similar to the iPhone 12, as opposed to the diagonal layout for iPhone 13, iPhone 14, and iPhone 15. USB Type-C port is used, albeit with USB 2.0 data transfer speeds up to 480 Mb/s.[15]


Price
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 16 has a starting price of US$799, while the iPhone 16 Plus starts at US$899. Pre-orders began on September 13, 2024, and sales started September 20.[16]


Criticism
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 16 has received positive feedback for several aspects, but also shows a few limitations. The upgraded design is a favourite, bringing a refreshed aesthetic with the available vibrant colour options, which feel more dynamic than past models. The display maintains Apple’ Super Retina HDR quality, but is limited to a 60Hz refresh rate, which some users find outdated compared to faster displays on cheaper competitor phones.[17][18]

List of iPhone models

The iPhone 4 is a smartphone that was developed and marketed by Apple Inc. It is the fourth generation of the iPhone lineup, succeeding the iPhone 3GS and preceding the iPhone 4s. Following a number of notable leaks, the iPhone 4 was first unveiled on June 7, 2010, at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco,[7] and was released on June 24, 2010, in the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Japan.

The iPhone 4 introduced a new hardware design to the iPhone family, which Apple's CEO Steve Jobs touted as the thinnest smartphone in the world at the time; it consisted of a stainless steel frame which doubled as an antenna, with internal components situated between two panels of aluminosilicate glass.[8] The iPhone 4 introduced Apple's new high-resolution "Retina display" (with a pixel density of 326 pixels per inch), while maintaining the same physical size and aspect ratio as its precursors, Apple's A4 system-on-chip, along with iOS 4—which notably introduced multitasking functionality and app folders. It was the first iPhone at the time to include a front-facing camera, which made possible Apple's new FaceTime video chat service, and the first to be released in a version for CDMA networks, ending AT&T's period as the exclusive carrier of iPhone products in the United States.

The iPhone 4 received a largely positive reception, with critics praising its revamped design and more powerful hardware, in comparison to previous models. While it was a market success (with over 600,000 pre-orders within 24 hours), the release of the iPhone 4 was plagued by highly publicized reports concerning abnormalities in its new antenna design that caused the device to lose its cellular signal if held in a certain way. Most direct contact with the phone's outer edge would cause a significant decrease in signal strength. Apple released iOS 4.0.1 to try to fix these issues, but were unsuccessful.[9]

The iPhone 4 spent the longest time as Apple's flagship iPhone model at fifteen months. Although the succeeding 4S was announced in October 2011, the 4 continued to be sold as a midrange model until September 2012, and thereafter as the entry-level offering in Apple's lineup until September 2013 with the announcement of the iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c. The iPhone 4 had one of the longest lifespans of any iPhone ever produced, spanning close to four years and available in some developing countries until early 2015.


History
--------------------------------------------------

Prototypes
--------------------------------------------------
Before the official unveiling of the iPhone 4 on June 7, 2010, two prototypes were brought to the attention of the media, breaching Apple's normally secretive development process. Many of the speculations regarding technical specifications proved accurate.


Engadget leak
--------------------------------------------------
On January 27, 2010, gadget website Engadget received leaked images of the unreleased first-generation iPad.[10] Unbeknownst to the editors and readers, these images contained two unreleased iPhone 4 models.[11] It wasn't until the subsequent Gizmodo release that they were aware of the complete contents of the images.[12]


Gizmodo leak
--------------------------------------------------
On April 19, 2010, gadget website Gizmodo reported that they had purchased an iPhone prototype for $5000, and furthermore, had conducted a product teardown of the device. The prototype was reported to have been lost by an Apple employee, Gray Powell, in Redwood City, California.[13] Shortly after Gizmodo published detailed information about the prototype, Apple's legal associates formally requested for the phone to be returned to Apple, and Gizmodo responded with the intent to cooperate.[14]

On April 23, officers from the Rapid Enforcement Allied Computer Team (REACT) task force of the California HTTAP Program raided the home of Jason Chen, the Gizmodo editor responsible for reviewing the prototype, seizing all of his computers and hard drives.[15] The Electronic Frontier Foundation criticized the raid as violating journalist source protection laws that forbid the seizure of journalist computers, as well as the suspicion that Apple had used its influence as a member of the steering committee, which is charged with direction and oversight of the California REACT task force to push police into action in a way that would not normally be conducted for this type of incident. Apple had already received the iPhone prototype before the raid when it was returned by Gizmodo.[16] The District Attorney stated that the investigation was suspended, and discontinued searching through the Gizmodo editor's belongings as they determine whether the shield laws are applicable, and cautioned that no charges have been issued at this point.[17][18]


Taoviet leak
--------------------------------------------------
Pictures and video of a second prototype were published on a Vietnamese website, Taoviet, on May 12, 2010.[19] It was almost identical to the first, and used an A4 chip manufactured by Apple.[20] The website purchased the prototype for $4,000.[21] DigiTimes reported that the screen resolution of the new phone was 960-by-640, which was confirmed by Apple at the iPhone 4's official announcement.


Release
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 4 was available for pre-order on June 15, 2010.[22] Customers attempting to pre-order the iPhone 4 reported problems with the pre-order process on the US and UK online Apple Stores which crashed due to the surge in traffic.[23] The same issue was reported with AT&T and SoftBank, Apple's exclusive partners in the United States and Japan respectively, who suspended advance sales of the iPhone 4 as demand threatened to exceed supply.[24] Retail stores were also unable to complete pre-order transactions due to the servers crashing.[25]

Apple and its partner carriers received 600,000 pre-orders for the iPhone 4 in the first 24 hours, the largest number of pre-orders Apple had received in a single day for any device up to that point.[26] Engadget reported that at 20:30 UTC, all iPhone 4 pre-order suppliers had sold out.[27] 1.7 million iPhone 4 models were sold in its first three days of availability.[28]

The iPhone 4 was also released through Orange in Tunisia and was available in eight cities at the launch.[29] On July 30, 2010, iPhone 4 was made available for sale in Australia, New Zealand and 15 other countries with free bumper cases.[30][31] In South Korea, it was released by KT on September 10. In Israel, it was released, too, on September 24, through Cellcom, Pelephone and Orange. It was launched in Thailand on September 23 by AIS, DTAC and True Move, and in Malaysia on September 26 in Kuala Lumpur, and nationwide on September 27 according to the Malaysian service provider Maxis.

The iPhone 4 was released in South Africa on September 22 on the Vodacom and MTN networks, in very limited quantities.[32] The iPhone 4 was launched in Vietnam on September 30 on VinaPhone and Viettel, at first in three major cities: Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City and Da Nang, and then all over the country by the end of October.

The iPhone 4 was launched in India on May 27, 2011 by Aircel and Airtel.[33]

On January 11, 2011, Verizon Wireless announced during a media event that it had reached an agreement with Apple and would begin selling a CDMA iPhone 4 in the United States, ending Apple's exclusivity agreement with AT&T. The Verizon iPhone went on sale on February 10 and pre orders began on February 3.[34][35][36] The Verizon iPhone includes the 'Personal Hotspot" feature which allows a user to use the iPhone as a wireless hotspot, with up to five devices connecting at one time. The February 3, 2011, presale of the iPhone 4 broke Verizon's first day sales records for a single device.[37]

On June 24, 2010, Apple stated that the white iPhone 4 models were proving more "challenging to manufacture" than expected, and initially pushed the release date back to the second half of July.[38] There was a lot of speculation surrounding the delay of the white iPhone 4. Among the most popular rumours are those concerning the phone's internal camera being adversely affected by light leaking in due to the semi-translucent glass and the white paint.[39][40] Other sources report that the problem relates to Apple's inability to match the white colour of the front faceplate with that of the home button.[41] On April 27, 2011, Apple announced that it would be releasing the white iPhone 4 model on April 28, 2011, for both GSM and CDMA.[42] The release of the white iPhone 4 was carried out on April 28.[43][44]

During Apple's official unveiling of the iPhone 4s on October 4, 2011, it was announced that Sprint would begin carrying the CDMA iPhone 4 and the iPhone 4s in the US on October 14.[45][46]


Discontinuation
--------------------------------------------------
In September 2013, after the release of the iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c, Apple stopped selling the iPhone 4 in most of their stores as well as on their website. It was replaced by the 8 GB iPhone 4s.[47][48][49]


Hardware
--------------------------------------------------

Display
--------------------------------------------------
The display of the iPhone 4 was manufactured by LG under an exclusive contract with Apple. It features an LED backlit TFT LCD capacitive touchscreen with a pixel density of 326 pixels per inch (ppi) on a 3.5 in (8.9 cm) (diagonally measured), 960×640 display. Each pixel is 78 micrometers in width. The display has a contrast ratio of 800:1. The screen was marketed by Apple as the "Retina display", based on the assertion that a display of approximately 300 ppi at a distance of 305 millimetres (12 in) from one's eye, or 57 arcseconds per pixel,[50] is the maximum amount of detail that the human retina can perceive.[51] With the iPhone expected to be used at a distance of about 12 inches from the eyes, a higher resolution would allegedly have no effect on the image's apparent quality as the maximum potential of the human eye has already been met.

This claim was widely disputed. Raymond Soneira, president of DisplayMate Technologies, said in an interview with the Wired magazine, that his claims by Jobs are something of an exaggeration: "It is reasonably close to being a perfect display, but Steve pushed it a little too far". Soneira stated that the resolution of the human retina is higher than claimed by Apple, working out to 477 PPI at 12 inches (305 mm) from the eyes, or 36 arcseconds per pixel.[52]

However, Phil Plait, author of Bad Astronomy, whose career includes a collaboration with NASA regarding the camera on the Hubble Space Telescope, responded to the criticism by stating that "if you have [better than 20/20] eyesight, then at one foot away the iPhone 4's pixels are resolved. The picture will look pixellated. If you have average eyesight, the picture will look just fine".[53][54]


Camera
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 4 features an additional front-facing 640x480 camera, and a backside-illuminated 5 megapixel rear-facing camera with a 3.85 mm f/2.8 lens[55][1] and an LED flash. The rear-facing 5-megapixel camera is capable of recording HD video in 720p at 30 frames per second. Both cameras make use of the tap to focus feature, part of iOS 4, for photo and video recording.[56] The rear-facing camera has a 5× digital zoom.


Connectivity
--------------------------------------------------
In contrast to Steve Jobs' announcement at WWDC 2010, Federal Communications Commission documentation showed that, in fact, the iPhone 4 contains a penta-band 3G UMTS antenna, not a quad-band 3G UMTS radio, as advertised by Apple [citation needed]. According to the FCC documentation filed by Apple, the radio inside the iPhone 4 supports 800, 850, 900, 1,900, and 2,100 MHz. The 800 MHz frequency, which is most commonly used in Japanese mobile phones, is not advertised as being supported by Apple.[57] However, the 800 MHz band is a subset of the 850 MHz band, which probably explains why the device was advertised as quad-band.[citation needed] The chip-sets were manufactured by Skyworks Solutions[58] and Infineon for GSM version.

As with most of Apple's mobile products at the time, the iPhone 4 also used the 30 pin dock connector as its only external data port.

The iPhone 4 is the first generation of iPhone to have a second microphone used for noise cancellation. It is located on the top of the unit near the headphone jack; the main microphone is on the bottom left.[59]


Gyroscope and accelerometer
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 4 introduces a gyroscopic sensor that detects 3-axis angular acceleration around the X, Y, and Z axes, enabling precise calculation of yaw, pitch, and roll. The gyroscope complements the accelerometer, a sensor that has been present since the original iPhone, which detects the device's acceleration, shake, vibration shock, or fall by detecting linear acceleration along with one of three axes (X, Y, and Z). The combined data from the accelerometer and the gyroscope provides detailed and precise information about the device's 6-axis movement in space. The 3 axes of the gyroscope combined with the 3 axes of the accelerometer enable the device to recognize approximately how far, fast, and in which direction it has moved in space.[60]


Processor, memory and storage
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 4 is powered by the Apple A4 chip, which was designed by Intrinsity[61] and, like all prior iPhone models, manufactured by Samsung.[62] This system-on-a-chip is composed of an ARM Cortex-A8 CPU integrated with a PowerVR SGX535 GPU.[63] The Apple A4 was also used in the first-generation iPad (released in 2010), where it was clocked at its rated speed of 1 GHz. The Apple A4 was the first ever mobile phone processor designed by Apple. The clock speed in the iPhone 4 was never disclosed. All prior models of the iPhone had underclocked the CPU, which typically extends battery life and lowers heat dissipation.

The iPhone 4 has 512 MB of DRAM. The additional DRAM supports increased performance and multi-tasking.[64] As on prior models, all data is stored in flash memory, 8, 16 or 32 GB, and not on the SIM. Unlike prior generations, the storage capacity is not printed on the back of the unit.


Micro-SIM
--------------------------------------------------
The GSM iPhone 4 uses a micro-SIM card, which is positioned in an ejectable tray, located on the right side of the device. The CDMA iPhone 4, however, the phone connects to the network using an ESN. All prior models have used regular mini-SIM cards. Depending on the operator, micro-SIM cards may not be available for all networks globally. As a technical workaround, it is possible to trim a mini-SIM card with a knife or scissors so that it fits into the micro-SIM tray.[65]


Design
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 4 features a redesigned structure, designed by Jony Ive, a design that would later be reused and adapted for the iPhone 4S, 5, 5S and first-generation iPhone SE. Most notably, the bulges of the back panel as well as the band between the front and back are gone and have been replaced with flattened surfaces. The redesign reflects the utilitarianism and uniformity of existing Apple products, such as the iPad and the iMac. The overall dimensions of the iPhone 4 have been reduced from their predecessor.[66]

It is 115 millimetres (4.5 in) high, 58.6 millimetres (2.31 in) wide, and 9.4 millimetres (0.37 in) deep, compared to the iPhone 3GS, which is 116 millimetres (4.6 in) high, 62 millimetres (2.4 in) wide, and 12 millimetres (0.47 in) deep; making the iPhone 4 24% thinner than its predecessor, the iPhone 3GS. Steve Jobs claimed it to be "the thinnest smartphone on the planet."[66] The reduced size of the device is primarily due to the externally placed antenna.

The iPhone 4 is structured around a stainless steel frame that wraps around the edge of the phone, acting both as the primary structure for the device and as the iPhone 4's antennas. This metal band features two slits on the GSM version of the phone, one at the lower left, and one at the top (and a fake slit along the lower right, to cosmetically mirror the one at the lower left) that divide the band into two antenna sections: the left section of the band serves as the Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and GPS antenna, and the right and lower sections of the band act as the antenna for GSM and UMTS connectivity.

On the CDMA version of the phone, there are four slits in the metal band. Two at the top (on the left and right) and two at the bottom. This divides the metal band into four different segments, which like the GSM version of the phone, serve as different antennas for connectivity. The top portion of the band (divided by the top left and right slits) is for connecting to the CDMA network. The left portion of the metal band is for Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and GPS just like the GSM version. The right side is not an antenna but serves to cosmetically mirror the left side and also to create a similar look to the GSM version of the phone.

The internal components are situated between two panels of aluminosilicate glass, described by Apple as being "chemically strengthened to be 20 times stiffer and 30 times harder than plastic," theoretically allowing it to be more scratch-resistant and durable than the prior models.[8]

In fall 2010, pentalobe screws started to replace the Philips screws used in post-repair units in the US and in production units in Japan.[67]


Software
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 4 shipped with iOS 4, which was the newest version of Apple's iOS mobile operating system at the time. iOS 4 introduced a multitasking system, allowing apps to remain "suspended" in memory, perform certain operations in the background, and allowing users to switch between apps using an on-screen menu.[68] It also introduced FaceTime, which allows users to perform video calls between other iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, and Mac OS X users.

The iPhone 4 supports up to iOS 7, released in September 2013. Due to the relatively aged hardware of the iPhone 4, most features available on newer iPhone models are not available on the device; as of iOS 7, they include Siri, 3D maps and turn-by-turn navigation, AirDrop, AirPlay mirroring, live camera filters, panorama mode and certain visual effects introduced by iOS 7, such as the blurring of translucent interface elements, the parallax effect on the home screen, and live wallpapers.[69] While still subject to the same limitations, iOS 7.1 did bring some slight performance improvements to the operating system on the iPhone 4. iOS 7, specifically iOS 7.1.2, is the last version of iOS to support the iPhone 4. Unlike the iPhone 4s, the iPhone 4 did not receive the iOS 8 update due to performance issues.[70][71]


Accessories
--------------------------------------------------

Bumper
--------------------------------------------------
Apple released a plastic and rubber case called the Bumper to protect the edges of the phone. The case, which also provided some screen protection, included buttons and holes that enabled switch and connector access.[72]

Apple updated the bumper with a wider volume switch hole with the release of the iPhone 4 for CDMA networks. The updated bumper is also compatible with iPhone 4s, the next-generation iPhone that has the same exterior design and measurements as the CDMA model of the iPhone 4, but with a SIM card slot as well.


Reception
--------------------------------------------------

Pre-release
--------------------------------------------------
Pre-release reception was largely positive.[73] The announcement included information that had not been covered by Gizmodo. Fox News commented that "seeing it in action is far more informative than staring at Gizmodo's photos of a busted test unit".[74] Rhodri Marsden of The Independent said that "aside from the introduction of face-to-face video calling, it's not a staggering feature set," instead focusing on how the device is "more powerful than its predecessor, speedier, easier to use and will make previously laborious tasks seem like a cinch".[75]

CNET reacted to the announcement by explaining how it believes that iMovie for iOS was the "most exciting part of this year's WWDC Keynote". The article noted how the iPhone 4, unlike current cameras, can record HD content and then edit it from the same device, labeling it a "true mobile editing suite".[76]


Reviews
--------------------------------------------------
Reviews of the iPhone 4 were largely positive. Walt Mossberg of The Wall Street Journal called the device "the best device in its class".[77] Engadget named it the "best smartphone on the market" in June 2010.[78] CNET gave the iPhone 4 a rating of 8.6 out of 10, one of the highest ratings it had given any smartphone.[79] TechRadar gave the device 4.5/5 stars.[80] Consumer Reports said the signal problem was the reason they did not rate it a "recommended" model, although the other tests ranked it highest among smartphones.[81]

Joshua Topolsky of Engadget described the device's industrial design as being "more detailed and sophisticated" than its predecessor.[78]


Technical problems
--------------------------------------------------
Some users reported a yellow discoloration of the screen that disappeared after several days, which was attributed to the glass lamination glue that was used. It did not have time to dry fully before the unit reached consumers due to the speed of manufacturing.[82] Another issue reported by some users within days of the iPhone 4 release was that during calls the proximity sensor can be insensitive, so that facial contact with the touchscreen can end calls, mute calls, and dial other numbers.[83] Some users reported that, particularly in low-light conditions, photos taken on the iPhone 4 sometimes contained blue or green "splotches." Issues with white balance were also discovered, particularly when using the flash.[84][85]


Antenna
--------------------------------------------------
Shortly after the iPhone 4 was launched, some users reported that signal strength of the phone was reduced when touching the lower left edge of the phone, bridging one of the two locations which separates the two antennas, resulting in dropped calls in some areas with lower signal reception.[86][87][88] In response, Apple issued a statement advising that customers should "avoid gripping [the phone] in the lower left corner" when making or receiving a call.[89] Internally, senior antenna expert Ruben Caballero raised concerns to CEO Steve Jobs that the antenna design could lead to dropped calls.[90]

As a consequence of this problem, it was reported on July 2, 2010 that several iPhone 4 users were planning on suing Apple and AT&T for fraud by concealment, negligence, intentional misrepresentation and defective design. The legal challenge was started by a law firm, who set up a website to recruit disenchanted iPhone 4 buyers for a lawsuit against Apple.[91][92] Later that day, Apple issued another statement stating that it had discovered the cause of the "dramatic drop in bars".[93]

Apple explained how the formula it used to calculate the number of bars to display was "totally wrong". Apple promised to correct the issue and release a software update within a few weeks that would address the "mistake", which had been present since the original iPhone.[93] The New York Times commented that "the failure to detect this longstanding problem earlier is astonishing."[94]

Consumer Reports initially stated that the iPhone 4's signal issues are not "unique, and may not be serious" and it continued to mention that signal loss is a problem that is faced by the entire smartphone industry. It was such a problem that Apple made a formal apology onstage. The next day, the magazine altered their stance after encountering instances of dropped calls.[95] The magazine rejected Apple's explanation after conducting tests in a controlled environment, and comparing the results against prior generations of iPhone. It sarcastically pointed out that using a piece of tape to cover the lower left antenna gap was one way to fix the problem, but recommended that consumers who "want an iPhone that works well without a masking-tape fix" purchase the iPhone 3GS instead.[81] The magazine also tested the iPhone 4 while it was wearing a Bumper, a frame-like cover sold by Apple that prevents direct contact with the antenna, reporting that it did resolve the problem.[96] CNN repeated Consumer Reports' statement that a small amount of duct tape had proven an effective fix to the iPhone 4's dropped call issue.[97]

On July 16, 2010, at a press conference which included a private tour of Apple's antenna design lab for journalists,[98] Steve Jobs announced that Apple would provide all iPhone 4 owners with a free case to help solve the antenna issue and a refund to those users who had already purchased a Bumper. The free case offer would be valid until September 30, 2010, when Apple would re-evaluate the situation.[99][100] To get a free case, owners were able to apply via an app installed on the phone found in the App Store from July 22, 2010 to September 30, 2010. Jobs also announced that Apple could not produce enough Bumpers for all owners of the phone, but would source a supply and offer a range of cases.[101] Additionally, Jobs cited figures from AppleCare which showed that only 0.55 percent of all iPhone 4 users have complained to the company about the issue, while the number of phones returned to Apple was 1.7 percent – 4.3 percentage points less than the number of iPhone 3GS models that were returned in the first month of the phone's launch.[101]

Consumer Reports noted that the solution was not permanent, though a good first step.[102] However, because Jobs did not specify a time line for fixing the problem, and the offering for a free bumper only being a temporary solution, PC World decided to remove the iPhone 4 from its "Top 10 Cell Phones" chart and reassign it to a pending rating.[103]

Despite the negative media attention regarding the antenna issues, 72% of iPhone 4 users said that they were "very satisfied" with their iPhone 4 according to an August 2010 survey by ChangeWave Research.[104] The GSM iPhone 4 continued to be sold unchanged until its discontinuation in September 2013, while the CDMA iPhone 4 and all models of the iPhone 4S featured a tweaked antenna design to prevent the issue from happening.


iPhones in space
--------------------------------------------------
In 2011, two iPhone 4 units equipped with a special application were taken to the International Space Station aboard the Space Shuttle on the STS-135 mission.[105] The devices were used in various experiments, utilizing sensors and a special app.[105]

List of iPhone models

The iPhone 5 is a smartphone that was developed and marketed by Apple Inc. It is the 6th generation iPhone, succeeding the iPhone 4s, and preceding both the iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c. It was formally unveiled as part of a press event on September 12, 2012, and subsequently released on September 21, 2012. The iPhone 5 was the first iPhone to be announced in September, and setting a trend for subsequent iPhone releases, the first iPhone to be completely developed under the guidance of Tim Cook and the last iPhone to be overseen by Steve Jobs. The iPhone 5's design was used three times, first with the iPhone 5 itself in 2012, then with the iPhone 5s in 2013, and finally with the first-generation iPhone SE in 2016.

The iPhone 5 featured major design changes in comparison to its predecessor. These included an aluminum-based body which was thinner and lighter than previous models, a taller 4-inch screen with a nearly 16:9 aspect ratio, the Apple A6 system-on-chip, LTE support, and Lightning, a new compact dock connector which replaced the 30-pin design used by previous iPhone models. This was the second iPhone after the iPhone 4s to include Apple's new Sony-made 8 MP camera.

Apple began taking pre-orders on September 14, 2012, and over two million were received within 24 hours. Initial demand for the iPhone 5 exceeded the supply available at launch on September 21, 2012, and was described by Apple as "extraordinary", with pre-orders having sold twenty times faster than its predecessors. While reception to the iPhone 5 was generally positive, consumers and reviewers noted hardware issues, such as an unintended purple hue in photos taken, and the phone's coating being prone to chipping. Reception was also mixed over Apple's decision to switch to a different dock connector design, as the change affected iPhone 5's compatibility with accessories that were otherwise compatible with previous iterations of the line.

The iPhone 5 was officially discontinued by Apple on September 10, 2013, with the announcement of its successors, the iPhone 5s and the iPhone 5c. The iPhone 5 has the joint second-shortest lifespan of any iPhone ever produced with only twelve months in production, breaking with Apple's standard practice of selling an existing iPhone model at a reduced price upon the release of a new model. This was broken by the iPhone X which only had ten-months in production from November 2017 to September 2018, and tied with the iPhone XS which had twelve-months from September 2018 to September 2019.

It was replaced as a midrange and then an entry-level device by the iPhone 5c; the 5c internal hardware specifications are almost identical to the 5 albeit having a less expensive polycarbonate exterior shell. The iPhone 5 supports iOS 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10. The iPhone 5 does not support iOS 11 due to it dropping support for 32-bit devices. The iPhone 5 is the second iPhone to support five major versions of iOS after the iPhone 4s.


History
--------------------------------------------------
Rumors about the iPhone 5 began shortly after the announcement of the iPhone 4s, though detailed leaks did not emerge until June 2012.[12] On July 30, 2012, reports pinpointed the dates on which the iPhone 5 would be unveiled and released, along with some accurate predictions of its features.[13] On September 4, 2012, Apple announced they would be hosting an event at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco on September 12, 2012. A shadow of the numeral 5 was featured in the invitations sent to the media, suggesting that the next iPhone would be unveiled at the event.[14]

At the unveiling, Apple announced the iPhone 5 and also introduced new iPod Nano and iPod Touch models. They also stated that pre-orders would be accepted starting September 14, 2012.[1][15] Over two million pre-orders were received within 24 hours.[5][16] The iPhone 5 was made available for sale to the public on September 21, 2012.[17] Initial demand for the new phone exceeded the record set by its predecessor, the iPhone 4s, by selling over 5 million units in the first three days.[18] On November 30, 2012, Apple added an unlocked version of the iPhone 5 to their online US store, with the 16 GB model starting at US$649.[19][20]

The iPhone 5 was officially discontinued by Apple on September 10, 2013, with the announcement of its successors, the iPhone 5s and the iPhone 5c.[21] While the 5c shared almost the same internal hardware as the iPhone 5, the 5c used a lower-cost polycarbonate plastic case in place of the original 5's aluminum form. The introduction of the 5c deviated from Apple's previous market strategy, where the previous iPhone model would remain in production, but sold at a lower price point below the new model.[21]

On April 28, 2014, Apple initiated an out of warranty recall program to replace any failing power buttons of iPhone 5 models which were manufactured prior to March 2013 at no cost.[22] On August 23, 2014, Apple announced a program to replace batteries of iPhone 5 models that "may suddenly experience shorter battery life or need to be charged more frequently" which were sold between September 2012 and January 2013.[23][24]


Litigation
--------------------------------------------------
Following the release of the iPhone 5, Samsung announced that it was filing a lawsuit against Apple for infringing eight of its patents. The case was scheduled to begin in 2014.[25] In a statement, Samsung said it had "little choice but to take the steps necessary to protect our innovations and intellectual property rights".[26] Litigation between the two involving patent infringement has been ongoing and is being fought in several court cases around the world.[27]


Production
--------------------------------------------------
The components and labor required to construct the most basic iPhone 5 are estimated to cost US$207, which is US$19 more than the cost of components for the corresponding iPhone 4s model. The LTE module in the iPhone 5 alone costs $34, $10 more than the cellular module in the iPhone 4s. Similarly, screens used in the iPhone 5 cost $44, which is $7 more than the screen of its predecessor. Mashable noted that the profit margin of selling each device is "huge" as the iPhone 5 retails for US$649.[28][29]

After the announcement of the device, a lack of supply was evident. This was due to a shortage of components such as the screen. Reports emerged, stating that Sharp was unable to ship the screen before the debut of the iPhone 5, and other manufacturers reported that it was difficult to keep up with demand. As a result, the number of pre-orders rose due to the uncertainty of stock at retail stores, and the delivery dates for pre-orders were postponed to dates that were after the initial release date of the device.[30]


Quality control inspectors strike
--------------------------------------------------
China Labor Watch, a New York State–based NGO, reported that "three to four thousand" Foxconn workers who work at the iPhone 5 production plant in Zhengzhou stopped working on October 5, 2012.[31] The strikes occurred after Apple implemented a stricter quality standard on their products, which includes a 0.02 mm restriction on indentations inflicted during production, and imposed demands related to scratches on frames and back covers.[31] The strikes were also attributed to the employer forcing employees to work on a public holiday. The report stated training was inadequate for quality demands expected and led to employees producing products that did not meet standards. During the strike, conflicts between quality control inspectors and employees resulted in brawls. China Labor Watch also claimed that concerns raised by inspectors were not addressed by factory management.[31] Foxconn spokesmen admitted that a micromanagement problem exists, but also said that there were only 300 to 400 workers absent and the conflicts did not influence production processes.[32] In November 2012 Foxconn chairman Terry Gou reported that the delay in production was due to undisclosed difficulties in assembly.[33]


Features
--------------------------------------------------

Operating system and software
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 5 features iOS, Apple's mobile operating system.[34] The user interface of iOS is based on the concept of direct manipulation, using multi-touch gestures. Interface control elements consist of sliders, switches, and buttons.[35] Interaction with the OS includes gestures such as swipe, tap, pinch, and reverse pinch, all of which have specific definitions within the context of the iOS operating system and its multi-touch interface. Internal accelerometers are used by some applications to respond to shaking the device (one common result is the undo command) or rotating it vertically (one common result is switching from portrait to landscape mode).[35]

The iPhone 5 is shipped with iOS 6, which was released on September 19, 2012.[34] Many of the iPhone 5's features that work specifically with the included iOS 6.0 operating system only worked in certain territories on release.[36] Apple has said this is a rolling program, which will take longer to implement across more regions.[37]

The phone can act as a hotspot, sharing its internet connection over WiFi, Bluetooth, or USB,[38] and also accesses the App Store, an online application distribution platform for iOS developed and maintained by Apple. The service allows users to browse and download applications from the iTunes Store that were developed with Xcode and the iOS SDK and were published through Apple.

The iPhone 5 can play music, movies, television shows, ebooks, audiobooks, and podcasts and can sort its media library by songs, artists, albums, videos, playlists, genres, composers, podcasts, audiobooks, and compilations. Options are always presented alphabetically, except in playlists, which retain their order from iTunes.[39] Users can rotate their device horizontally to landscape mode to access Cover Flow. Like on iTunes, this feature shows the different album covers in a scroll-through photo library. Scrolling is achieved by swiping a finger across the screen. Alternatively, headset controls can be used to pause, play, skip, and repeat tracks. On the iPhone 5, the volume can be changed with the included Apple Earphones, and the Voice Control feature can be used to identify a track, play songs in a playlist or by a specific artist, or create a Genius playlist.[39]

Like the iPhone 4s, the iPhone 5 has Siri,[39] that allows the user to operate the iPhone by spoken commands. The software was improved in iOS 6 to include the ability to make restaurant reservations, launch apps, dictate Facebook or Twitter updates, retrieve movie reviews and detailed sports statistics.[40]

On the iPhone 5, texting can be aided by the voice assistant, which converts speech to text.[39] In addition to regular texting, messaging on the iPhone 5 supports iMessage, a specialized instant messaging program and service that allows unlimited texting to other Apple devices running iOS 5 or later. This supports the inclusion of content such as images and sound in text messages, integration with the device's voice-controlled software assistant, and read acknowledgments for sent messages. Input to the device comes from a keyboard displayed on the multi-touch screen or by voice-to-text by speaking into the microphone. Entered text is supported by predictive and suggestion software; there is a multi-language spell-checker which recognizes many regional accents of different languages.[39]

iOS 6 features several new and/or updated apps, which includes Apple Maps and Passbook. Apple's built-in Maps app, which replaced the former Maps app powered by Google Maps, had been universally derided and lacked many features present in competing maps apps.[41][42] It uses Apple's new vector-based engine that eliminates lag, making for smoother zooming. New to Maps is turn-by-turn navigation spoken directions, 3D views in some major cities and real-time traffic.[40][43] iOS 6 is able to retrieve documents such as boarding passes, admission tickets, coupons and loyalty cards through its new Passbook app. An iOS device with Passbook can be scanned under a reader to process a mobile payment at locations that have compatible hardware. The app has context-aware features such as notifications for relevant coupons when in the immediate vicinity of a given store.[40][44]

Facebook comes integrated through Apple's native apps with iOS 6. Facebook features can be directly accessed from within native apps such as Calendar which can sync Facebook events, or use Facebook's like button from within the Apple App Store.[40]

New privacy settings are available to the user. In addition to location services, the following have been added in iOS 6: photos (already partially restricted in iOS 5), contacts (address book), calendars, reminders, Bluetooth sharing, Twitter, Facebook, and Sina Weibo. iOS 6 also comes with a "Limit ad tracking" user control in the general settings menu to allow users the option to prevent targeted advertising. Apple's Advertising Identifier replaces the company's existing Unique Device Identification (UDID) standard. Advertising networks not yet using Apple's Advertising Identifier device identifier standard would not be affected, although Apple will require the standard in the future.[45]


Design
--------------------------------------------------
Apple emphasized the improved build quality of the iPhone 5 at its press event.[15] The frame used in previous versions was redesigned to use an aluminum composite frame.[46] The iPhone 4 and iPhone 4s used stainless steel instead of aluminium due to Steve Jobs' preference for the metal which he thought, "looks beautiful when it wears".[47]

The iPhone 5 is 18% thinner, 20% lighter, and has 12% less overall volume than its predecessor, the iPhone 4s.[48] The phone's aluminum body is 0.30 in (7.6 mm) thick. At the September 2012 conference Apple claimed it was the thinnest smartphone in the world at 7.6 mm, though that claim was disputed as the Chinese Oppo Finder was thinner and some other smartphones could be considered to be thinner, depending upon where thickness is measured. The Oppo Finder measured 6.65 mm (0.262 in) at its thinnest point and 7.1 mm (0.28 in) at its thickest point making it overall thinner than the iPhone.[49][50][51][52] This design was used three times, first with the iPhone 5 in 2012, then with the 5s in 2013, and finally with the first-generation iPhone SE in 2016.


Hardware
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 5 uses a system on chip (SoC), called the Apple A6.[17][53][54] The SoC comprises a 1.3 GHz dual-core processor, 1 GB of RAM and a tri-core PowerVR SGX543MP4 running at 266 MHz.[55][56] The iPhone 5's operating memory (LPDDR2-1066 eDRAM) was doubled, from 512 MB to 1 GB. Storage capacities available are fixed at 16, 32 or 64 GB, the same as the 4s; plug-in memory cards are not supported.[57] The two color options are black (with black glass and slate-colored metal trim), and white (with white ceramic and silver-colored metal trim); again the same color options (though differently implemented) as its predecessor the 4s had.[58] The iPhone 5 retains the 8 megapixel back camera on the iPhone 4s, but has improved low-light performance, and has a 40% faster photo capture[59] than its predecessors, while having a purple hue when a strong source of light is present in the photograph.[60] The front camera, which is accessible through the FaceTime and camera app has a lower resolution, at 1.2 megapixels. The rechargeable lithium-ion battery with a charge capacity of 1440mAh[9] is built in and cannot be replaced by the user; it is rated at ≤225 hours of standby time and ≤8 hours of talk time. There are three separate models of the phone available: one supporting CDMA and two GSM versions.[61][62] This can have knock-on effects for which version of the device will actually work in which countries/regions.[citation needed] The phone takes a nano-SIM, smaller than the micro-SIM of the iPhone 4 and iPhone 4s.[63]

Hardware benchmarking conducted using Geekbench and GLBenchmark validates several claims that Apple included on their website and mentioned at the unveiling of the device, these include two times faster and two times the graphics performance. In the Geekbench overall hardware assessment, the iPhone 5 received a score that was approximately 2.5 times higher than the iPhone 4s. The benchmark conducted using GLBenchmark for the iPhone 5 returned a score that was 2 times better than the iPhone 4s. The result was however inconsistent as a 3D graphics benchmark assessment using Passmark returned a score that was only approximately 1.45 times better than the iPhone 4s.[64][65] Battery life assessments conducted by AnandTech concluded that the battery life is shorter on the iPhone 5 than its predecessor when performing certain tasks, however when performing other tasks the iPhone 5 battery outlasts the iPhone 4s.[66]

The Retina Display is 1,136 × 640 pixels with an aspect ratio of almost exactly 16:9, (minus one extra row of horizontal pixels). With a diagonal of 4" it has a display size of 6.7 square inches, compared to 5.7 in iPhone 4 and 4s.[67] The pixel density remains the same as the 4s model, which is 326 pixels per inch. Screen icons of the iPhone 5 are arranged in a matrix of six rows of four icons each. The increased screen size allows the sixth row of icons to be added to the five rows that were present in the iPhone 4. In-cell touch sensor technology from Sharp slims the screen which allows for a thinner phone. The screen's color saturation is 44% greater than its predecessor.[68]

There are three microphones (placed on the front, side and back) for noise cancellation and video calls.[69]

On April 28, 2014, Apple initiated an out of warranty recall program to replace any failing power buttons of iPhone 5 models which were manufactured prior to March 2013 at no cost.[22]

On August 23, 2014, Apple announced a program to replace batteries of iPhone 5 models that "may suddenly experience shorter battery life or need to be charged more frequently" which were sold between September 2012 and January 2013.[23][24]


Accessories
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 5, as well as the iPod Touch (5th generation), iPod Nano (7th generation), iPad (4th generation), and iPad Mini feature a new dock connector named Lightning, which replaces the 30-pin Apple Dock connector introduced in 2003 by Apple on the iPod (3rd generation). The Apple Lightning connector has eight pins and all signaling is digital. This new connector is smaller than the previous one, helping the iPhone 5 to be slimmer than its predecessors.[70] Apple Lightning cables have duplicate pins on two sides of each plug, so it can be inserted either way round. Various accessories will be available to convert the Apple Lightning connector to the older 30-pin Apple Dock connector or USB,[71] although not all old accessories will work, as not all signals are available, in particular video output and the iPod Out feature for BMW automobiles.[72][73][74]

Earphones known as Apple EarPods are included with the iPhone 5 and other devices announced at the Apple media event on September 12, 2012. They superseded earphones that were included with previous generation iPhones and iPods.[75] According to technology commentators, the redesign of the earphones is aimed to improve sound quality by allowing air to travel in and out more freely.[76][77] Apple states that the redesign of their earphones allows it to "rival high-end headphones that cost hundreds of dollars more".[76] Reviews by Gizmodo and TechRadar reported that although the redesigned earphones sounded better than its predecessor, reviewers felt that quality of sound produced is poor.[78]


Network compatibility
--------------------------------------------------
AT&T, Verizon, and Sprint offer LTE access in the US,[84] while in the UK, only EE and Three are able to offer LTE access.[85] On March 26, 2013, T-Mobile announced they would begin carrying the iPhone 5, making it the first iPhone to be available on all four nationwide carriers in the United States.[86] The T-Mobile version of the iPhone features a modified version of the A1428 iPhone 5 model enabling Advanced Wireless Services (AWS) support.[87] All carriers in Canada selling the iPhone 5 have their own LTE networks, including Rogers Wireless, Fido Solutions, Bell Mobility, Virgin Mobile Canada, Telus Mobility and Koodo Mobile.[88][89]

42 officially recognized bands exist for LTE, however rollouts are coalescing around the more-popular bands, based on what historically has been made available in specific regions. In Europe, bands available for LTE include, 2.6 GHz (the 3G-expansion band) and 800 MHz (cleared of analogue TV), with 1,800 MHz appearing in a few places including the UK. In Germany, the only carrier network supported is that of T-Mobile with its 1,800 MHz band allocated to LTE.[90][91] Some countries in Europe, including Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and others—will not be able to offer LTE connectivity via the iPhone 5 to their customers on their current LTE networks, as they have already deployed LTE in the 2.6 GHz band, which the iPhone 5 does not support.[92] In November 2012, a representative of Swisscom reported that the iPhone 5 only supports LTE on networks that have been tested and certified by Apple.[93][94]

Unlike the iPhone 4s, which was the only "world phone" produced by Apple, there are three versions of the iPhone 5, which differ by the frequency used. All three work on 2G GSM/GPRS and 3G UMTS/EDGE networks on both the 800 and 1900 MHz bands used in the Americas, and the 900 and 1800 MHz bands used elsewhere. The CDMA A1429 model works on CDMA networks, such as that of Sprint and Verizon. Another version supports LTE only on the 1700/2100 MHz AWS band, and the 700 MHz band recovered after the conversion to digital television in the US (channels 52 to 56), currently the only network that supports the band is AT&T. GSM A1429 supports several other LTE bands available in other countries, such as LTE bands 1, 3, 5.[62][95]


Reception
--------------------------------------------------

Critical reception
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 5 received mainly positive reviews from commentators and reviewers. Tim Stevens from Engadget praised the iPhone 5 for its high resolution screen surpassing that of the iPhone 4s, which he considered to be one of the best phone screens available on the market. Stevens was critical of the new connector, which is incompatible with devices and cables that use the superseded 30-pin connector, although the LA Times reported that this was a change necessary to make the device smaller than its predecessor.[70] Engadget agreed that Apple fulfilled most of the promises stated on its website, such as "better battery performance", "two times the graphics performance" and "two times faster."[96] David Pogue of The New York Times considered the 4-inch Retina display a "nice but not life-changing change", and praised the Lightning connector for its size, sturdiness, and reversibility, while noting its lack of support for older accessories, remarking that "Apple has a long history of killing off technologies, inconveniently and expensively, that the public had come to love".[97] Technology columnist Ed Baig of USA Today was impressed that Apple had met the public's "lofty expectations" for the iPhone 5 in a competitive market.[98] In a repair-ability review, iFixit found the iPhone 5 easier to disassemble and repair than its predecessor.[9][99]

Wired reported that the iPhone 5 design, carried on in the iPhone 5s and first-generation iPhone SE, was regarded as "long been the golden child of Apple phone design and a benchmark for phones in general", while the succeeding iPhone 6/6s design was less critically acclaimed as it "felt a little bit wrong, as though you were holding a slick $650 bar of soap". Wired described the iPhone 5 as "elegance rooted in the way the aluminum and glass work together. It felt streamlined, yet substantial, which is different from the iPhone 6, which feels substantial in size alone. Plus, unlike the ubiquitous rounded corners of the 6, the iPhone 5 didn't really look like anything else on the market at the time". However, the iPhone 5's design was not suited to scaling up, in contrast to the iPhone 6/6s which could better accommodate the growing consumer trend towards larger screen sizes and indeed spawned the 6/6S Plus phablet models.[100][101]


Criticism
--------------------------------------------------
Reviewers and commentators were critical of the new Maps app that replaced Google Maps in iOS 6. It had been reported to contain errors such as misplacement of landmark tags, directing users to incorrect locations and poor satellite images.[102][103][104] Nine days after Maps' release, Apple issued a statement apologizing for the frustration it had caused customers and recommending that they try alternate mapping services.[105]


Errors
--------------------------------------------------
Gizmodo editor Diaz discussed the correspondence between Apple and a reader about purple flare in pictures taken on iPhone 5 camera. Apple's response to the issue was that it is normal and advised the customer to aim the camera away from bright light sources when taking photos.[106] Tests conducted by TechCrunch indicate that the problem existed on the iPhone 4s but was more distinct and pronounced on the iPhone 5.[107] Consumer Reports found that the purple haze effect occurred on several other manufacturers' phones including the Samsung Galaxy S III and Motorola Droid Razr Maxx, and that it was not less pronounced on the iPhone 4s. The report concluded that digital cameras in general, including higher-end SLRs, can all suffer from lens flare in which a purple-tinted effect was not uncommon.[108]


Problems
--------------------------------------------------
There were anecdotal claims of the coating of primarily black iPhone 5s chipping off, exposing the bright aluminium underneath. Apple executive's response to email correspondence from an affected customer summarized that it was normal for aluminum to scratch.[109][110] The term "scuffgate", a reference to "antennagate" which affected the iPhone 4, was applied by various sources such as CNET, Yahoo News, and All Things Digital to describe the scuffing issue.[111][112]

Some users reported on the Internet that the white model leaked light behind the screen, though the issue was not unique to the iPhone 5, as it also affected other Apple devices.[113]


Commercial reception
--------------------------------------------------
Techcrunch reported that the iPhone 5 sold out twenty times faster than the 4 and 4s models. Apple said that they were "blown away by the customer response".[114] Phil Schiller, Apple's vice-president of worldwide marketing, said that over two million iPhone 5 orders had been received in the first 24 hours.[5][115] AT&T said that the iPhone 5 was the fastest-selling iPhone the company had ever offered, selling over five million units on launch weekend and exceeding the supply available.[6][116][117] The release and sale of the iPhone 5 has also slowed down the growth of Android according to market share reports released by Kantar Worldpanel ComTech.[118] During the first 16 days after the phone's initial release it comprised over 20% of all phones sold in that period.[119]

J.P. Morgan's chief economist, Michael Feroli said that "sales of iPhone 5 could boost annualized US GDP growth by $3.2 billion, or $12.8 billion at an annual rate."[120] Shortly after the announcement of the iPhone 5 and preceding the launch, Apple's stock price rose to a record $705.07,[121] but within three months fell to $507.48.[122] According to the analysis of Eric Savitz, Apple's stock decline and resulting losses were not the result of any issue with the new Maps application, but disappointed investors. He points to initial hardware sales of only five million, compared to projections up to twice that, as the primary cause.[123]

Since the release of the iPhone 5, discounts on previous generation iPhones have enabled Apple to maintain a market lead in the United States and Japan, but the iPhone continued to lag behind the combined total of Android phones in the global market.[124]

List of iPhone models

The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are smartphones that were developed and marketed by Apple Inc. They are the eighth generation of the iPhone, succeeding the iPhone 5, iPhone 5c and iPhone 5s, and were announced on September 9, 2014, and released on September 19, 2014.[20] The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus jointly were themselves replaced as the flagship devices of the iPhone series by the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus on September 9, 2015. The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus include larger 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch displays, a faster processor, upgraded cameras, improved LTE and Wi-Fi connectivity and support for a near-field communications-based mobile payments offering.[21][22]

The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus received positive reviews, with critics regarding their redesign, specifications, camera, and battery life as being improvements over previous iPhone models. However, aspects of the design of iPhone 6 were also criticized, including plastic strips on the rear of the device for its antenna that disrupted the otherwise metal exterior, and the screen resolution of the standard-sized iPhone 6 being lower than other devices in its class. The iPhone 6 sold extremely well, making it the best-selling iPhone model and the most successful smartphone to date.

The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus have been the subject of several hardware issues, including most prominently, being susceptible to bending under hard pressure (dubbed "Bendgate"), and as a byproduct of this lack of rigidity, the touchscreen's internal hardware being susceptible to losing its connection to the phone's logic board (nicknamed "Touch Disease"). Additionally, some iPhone 6 Plus models were the subject of camera issues, including some with malfunctioning optical image stabilization or otherwise defects on rear cameras.

The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were moved to the midrange spot in Apple's iPhone lineup when the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus were released in September 2015. The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were discontinued in most markets on September 7, 2016, when Apple announced the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Their spot as the entry-level iPhone was replaced by the first-generation iPhone SE, which was released earlier on March 31, 2016. The iPhone 6 was relaunched with 32 GB of storage in Asian markets in February 2017 as a midrange/budget iPhone. It was later expanded to Europe,[23][24] before hitting the US markets in May 2017,[25] and Canada in July 2017.[26] The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus supported iOS 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 before being dropped by iOS 13, and they are the third to support five versions of iOS after the iPhone 4s and the iPhone 5.


History
--------------------------------------------------
From the launch of the original iPhone to the iPhone 4s, iPhones used 3.5-inch displays—which are smaller than screens used by flagship phones from competitors. The iPhone 5 and its immediate successors featured a display that was taller, but the same width as prior models, measuring at 4 inches diagonally. Following Apple's loss in smartphone market share to companies producing phones with larger displays, reports as early as January 2014 suggested Apple was preparing to launch new iPhone models with larger, 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch displays.[27][28][29] Reports prior to its unveiling also speculated Apple might use a new iPhone model to introduce a mobile payments platform using near-field communications—a technology that was incorporated into many Android phones, but had experienced a low adoption rate among users.[30]

The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus were officially unveiled during a press event at the Flint Center for Performing Arts in Cupertino, California on September 9, 2014, and released on September 19, 2014; pre-orders began on September 12, 2014, with the iPhone 6 starting at US$199 and the iPhone 6 Plus starting at US$299.[31] In China, where the iPhone 5c and 5s were the first models in the iPhone series to be released in the country on the same day as their international launch, Apple notified local wireless carriers it would be unable to release the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus on the 19th there were "details which are not ready"; local media reported the devices had not yet been approved by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, and earlier in the year, a news report by state broadcaster China Central Television alleged iPhone devices were a threat to national security because iOS 7's "frequent locations" function could expose "state secrets."[32][33]

In August 2015, Apple initiated a replacement program for some early iPhone 6 Plus models that were found to have potentially faulty cameras that could be causing photos to appear blurry.[34][35][36]

On September 9, 2015, with the release of the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were moved to the mid-range of the iPhone lineup. The 128 GB versions of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus was discontinued along with the gold version of both phones, but the 16 GB and 64 GB versions of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in silver and space gray remained available for sale at a reduced price.[37]

In June 2016, Apple faced a potential sales ban in China, as Shenzhen Baili, a Chinese device maker, alleged the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus infringed on its design patent.[38]

The iPhone 6 was temporary discontinued on September 7, 2016, and the 6 Plus was permanently discontinued on same date, when Apple announced the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, and the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus' spot as the entry-level iPhone was taken by the first-generation iPhone SE. As the iPhone SE has more powerful internal hardware than the midrange iPhone 6 (largely the same as the 6S) and had been released earlier on March 31, 2016, this created an unusual situation when it was sold alongside the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus until September 7 despite being marketed as a lower-tier iPhone.

In February 2017, the iPhone 6 was quietly relaunched in carrier stores and online, this time the storage has been changed to 32 GB. In India, it was sold on Amazon's website in Space Grey. In Taiwan, it was sold through Taiwan Mobile on March 10 in gold color. In mid-March, it was released in the EU to Belarus via the i-Store webshop. It also makes an appearance in North America with Sprint based US prepaid carriers Boost Mobile and Virgin Mobile, along with AT&T GoPhone. These are not being distributed by Apple on their website or their retail stores.


Specifications
--------------------------------------------------

Hardware
--------------------------------------------------

Design
--------------------------------------------------
The design of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus is influenced by that of the iPad Air with a glass front that is curved around the edges of the display, and an aluminum rear that contains two plastic strips for the antenna.[39] The back is built of 6000-series aluminum.[40] Both models come in gold, silver, and "space gray" finishes. The iPhone 6 has a thickness of 6.9 millimetres (0.27 in), while the iPhone 6 Plus is 7.1 mm (0.28 in) in thickness; both are thinner than the iPhone 5c and iPhone 5s, with the iPhone 6 being Apple's thinnest phone to date.


Displays
--------------------------------------------------
The most significant changes to the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are its displays; both branded as "Retina HD Display" and "ion-strengthened", the iPhone 6 display is 4.7 inches in size with a 16:9 resolution of 1334x750 (326 ppi, minus one row of pixels), while the iPhone 6 Plus includes a 5.5-inch 1920x1080 (1080p) display (401 PPI). The displays use a multiple-domain LCD panel, dubbed "dual-domain pixels"; the RGB pixels themselves are skewed in a pattern so every pixel is seen from a different angle. This technique helps improve the viewing angles of the display.[41]

To accommodate the larger physical size of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, the top button was renamed to "side button" and moved to the side of the phone instead of the top to improve its accessibility.[21][22]


Batteries
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 6 features a 6.91 Wh (1,810 mAh) battery, while the iPhone 6 Plus features an 11.1 Wh (2,915 mAh) battery, neither of which are user-replaceable.[citation needed]


Chipsets
--------------------------------------------------
Both models include an Apple A8 system-on-chip, and an M8 motion co-processor—an update of the M7 chip from the iPhone 5s. The primary difference between the M8 and the original M7 coprocessor is the M8 also includes a barometer to measure altitude changes. Phil Schiller said the A8 chip would provide, in comparison to the 5s, a 25% increase in CPU performance, a 50% increase in graphics performance, and less heat output. Early hands-on reports said the A8's GPU performance might indeed break away from previous generations doubling of performance at each yearly release, scoring 21204.26 in Base mark X compared to 20253.80, 10973.36 and 5034.75 on respectively the 5s, 5 and 4s.[42]


Connectivity
--------------------------------------------------
The expanded LTE connectivity on the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus is improved to LTE Advanced, with support for over 20 LTE bands (seven more than the iPhone 5s),[43] for up to 150 Mbit/s download speed, and VoLTE support. Wi-Fi performance has been improved with support for 802.11ac specifications, providing speeds up to 433.0581 Mbit/s—which is up to three times faster than 802.11n,[43] along with Wi-Fi Calling support where available. The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus adds support for near-field communications (NFC). It is initially used exclusively for Apple Pay—a new mobile payments system which allows users to store their credit cards in Passbook for use with online payments and retail purchases over NFC.[44][45] iOS 11 added limited use of near-field communications besides Apple Pay for 3rd party apps.[46]


Camera
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 6's rear-facing camera now has the ability to shoot 1080p Full HD video at either 30 or 60 frames per second and 720p HD slow-motion video at either 120 or 240 frames per second, while the iPhone 5s could only record at 30 and 120 frames per second respectively.[citation needed] Unlike the previous models, the rear-facing camera is not flush with the rear of the device, but instead protrudes slightly.[47]

Still photos can be captured during video recording. Those have a resolution of four megapixels (2720×1532).[48][49]

The camera also includes phase detection autofocus.[50] The iPhone 6 Plus camera is nearly identical, but also includes optical image stabilization.[21][22] The front-facing camera was also updated with a new sensor and f/2.2 aperture, along with support for burst and HDR modes.[21][22]

However, the optical image stabilization of the iPhone 6 Plus is only available for photography and deactivated during video recording.[14]

The front camera has 1.3 Megapixels and records video up to 720p at 30 frames per second.[12]


Sensors
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus are the first iPhones to be equipped with a barometer sensor.[51]

Like the predecessor, the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus are equipped with an accelerometer, gyroscope, front-facing proximity sensor and a digital compass.[12]


Software
--------------------------------------------------
When first released, the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus were supplied pre-loaded with iOS 8. Apps are able to take advantage of the increased screen size in the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus to display more information on-screen; for example, the Mail app uses a dual-pane layout similar to its iPad version when the device is in landscape mode on the iPhone 6 Plus. As it uses an identical aspect ratio, apps designed for the iPhone 5, iPhone 5c, and 5s can be upscaled for use on the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. To improve the usability of the devices' larger screens, an additional "Reachability" gesture was added; double-tapping the Home button will slide the top half of the screen's contents down to the bottom half of the screen. This function allows users to reach buttons located near the top of the screen, such as a "Back" button in the top-left corner.[21][22] Tapping it once resets the screen timeout so the user does not have to look at the screen for an empty spot to tap on.[52]

In June 2019, Apple announced that it would drop support for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus with the release of iOS 13.[53][54][55]


Reception
--------------------------------------------------
Both iPhone 6 models received positive reviews. Re/code called it "the best smartphone you can buy".[56] TechRadar praised the iPhone 6's "brilliant" design, improved battery life over the 5s, iOS 8 for being "smarter and more intuitive than ever", along with the quality of its camera. However, the plastic antenna strips on the rear of the phone were criticized for resulting in poor aesthetics, the display for having lower resolution and pixel density in comparison to other recent smartphones – including those with the same physical screen size as the iPhone 6, such as the HTC One, and for not having a sufficient justification for its significantly higher price in comparison to similar devices running Android or Windows Phone.[57] The Verge considered the iPhone 6 to be "simply and cleanly designed" in comparison to the 5s, noting the phone still felt usable despite its larger size, but criticized the antenna plastic, the protruding camera lens (which prevents the device from sitting flat without a case), and the lack of additional optimization in the operating system for the bigger screen. Improvements such as performance, battery life, VoLTE support, and other tweaks were also noted. In conclusion, the iPhone 6 was considered "good, even great, but there's little about it that's truly ambitious or truly moving the needle. It's just a refinement of a lot of existing ideas into a much more pleasant package".[39]

In regards to the 6 Plus, Engadget panned its design for being uncomfortable to hold and harder to grip in comparison to other devices such as the Galaxy Note 3 and LG G3, but praised its inclusion of optical image stabilization and slightly better battery life than the 6.[50]

The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus have been criticized by Forbes Magazine for the lack of 2160p (3840×2160 pixels) video recording due to the insufficient image sensor resolution of 3264×2448 pixels. However, third-party software is able to record footage at 3264×1836 pixels upscaled to 3840×2160p.[58]


Issues
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were affected by a number of notable hardware-related issues, including but not limited to concerns surrounding their rigidity (which led to incidents surrounding chassis bending, as well as degradation or outright loss of touchscreen functionality), performance issues on models with larger storage capacity, camera problems on the 6 Plus model, as well as an initially undocumented "error 53" that appeared under certain circumstances.




Bendgate (chassis bending)
--------------------------------------------------
Shortly after its public release, it was reported the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus chassis was susceptible to bending under pressure, such as when carried tightly in a user's pocket. While such issues are not exclusive to the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, the design flaw came to be known among users and the media as "Bendgate".[59][60]

Apple responded to the bending allegations, stating they had only received nine complaints of bent devices and that the damage occurring due to regular use is "extremely rare." The company maintained the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus went through durability testing to ensure they would stand up to daily use.[61] The company offered to replace phones that were bent if it is determined the bending was unintentional.[59]

In May 2018, as part of a lawsuit against Apple regarding touchscreen failure, it was revealed via internal documents that Apple knew the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus phones were more likely to bend than previous models. According to the court documents, Apple's internal tests found the iPhone 6 was 3.3 times more likely to bend than the iPhone 5s, while the larger iPhone 6 Plus was 7.2 times more likely to bend.[62][63]


Hair ripping
--------------------------------------------------
On October 3, 2014 9to5Mac released a post claiming certain iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus users complained on social networking sites the phone ripped off their hair when they held the phone close to their ears when making phone calls.[64] Twitter users claimed the seam between the glass screen and aluminum back of the iPhone 6 was to blame, with hair becoming caught within it.[65][66]


Flash storage performance
--------------------------------------------------
Some users reported the 64 and 128 GB iPhone 6 models had experienced performance issues, and that some 128 GB iPhone 6 Plus models would, in rare cases, randomly crash and reboot. Business Korea reported the issues were connected to the triple-level cell NAND storage of the affected models. Triple-level NAND flash can store three bits of data per cell of flash, and are cheaper than dual-level cell solutions, but at the cost of performance. It was reported Apple had planned to switch the affected model lines back to multi-level cell flash, and address the performance issues on existing devices in a future iOS update.[67][68][69]


iPhone 6/6 Plus camera issues
--------------------------------------------------
It was reported the optical image stabilization systems on some iPhone 6 Plus models were faulty, failing to properly stabilize when the phone is being held perfectly still, leading to blurry photos and "wavy"-looking videos.[70] The optical image stabilization system was also found to have been affected by accessories that use magnets, such as third-party lens attachments; Apple issued advisories to users and its licensed accessory makers, warning magnetic or metallic accessories can cause the OIS to malfunction.[71]

On August 21, 2015, Apple instituted a repair program for iPhone 6 Plus models released between September 2014 and January 2015, citing faulty rear cameras on affected models may produce blurry pictures.[34][35][36]

Some iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus models have an issue in which the front-facing camera is somehow "shifted", or out of place. Apple stated they would replace most affected iPhone 6 models with this issue, free of charge. Despite numerous complaints regarding this issue, it does not seem to affect the camera itself. It is said the camera is not what has shifted, but a piece of protective foam around the camera module itself that has gone out of place.[72]


"Error 53"
--------------------------------------------------
If the iPhone 6 home button is repaired or modified by a third party, the device will fail security checks related to Touch ID as the components have not been "re-validated" for security reasons—a process that can only be performed by an authorized Apple outlet. Failing these checks disables all features related to Touch ID. Such effects have sometimes happened as a result of damage as well.[73][74]

It was reported these same hardware integrity checks would trigger an unrecoverable loop into "Recovery Mode" if iOS is updated or restored, with attempts to restore the device via iTunes software resulting in an "error 53" message. Beyond the explanation this is related to hardware integrity errors regarding Touch ID components, Apple provided no official explanation of what specifically triggers error 53 or how it can be fixed without replacing the entire device.[73][74]

On February 18, 2016, Apple released an iOS 9.2.1 patch through iTunes which addresses this issue and admitted error 53 was actually related to a diagnostic check for inspecting the Touch ID hardware before an iPhone is shipped from its factories.[75]


Touchscreen failure ("touch disease")
--------------------------------------------------
Touchscreen control components on iPhone 6 logic boards have insufficient support, including a lack of underfill—which strengthens and stabilizes integrated circuits, and a lack of rigid metal shielding on the logic board unlike previous iPhone models; the touchscreen controller is instead shielded by a flexible "sticker". Normal use of the device can cause the logic board to flex internally, which strains the touchscreen IC connectors and leads to a degradation or outright loss of touchscreen functionality. A symptom that has been associated with this type of failure is a flickering grey bar near the top of the display.[76][77] iFixit reported this issue, nicknamed "touch disease",[76][78][79] was a byproduct of the previous "Bendgate" design flaw because of the device's demonstrated lack of rigidity. As such, the larger iPhone 6 Plus is more susceptible to the flaw, but it has also been reported on a small percentage of iPhone 6 models.[79][80][81] The devices' successor, the iPhone 6s, is not afflicted by this flaw due to changes to their internal design, which included the strengthening of "key points" in the rear casing, and the re-location of the touchscreen controllers to the display assembly from the logic board.[80]

Initially, Apple did not officially acknowledge this issue. The issue was widely discussed on Apple's support forum—where posts discussing the issue have been subject to censorship.[77] The touchscreen can be repaired via microsoldering: Apple Stores are not equipped with the tools needed to perform the logic board repair, which had led to affected users sending their devices to unofficial, third-party repair services. An Apple Store employee interviewed by Apple Insider reported six months after they first started noticing the problem, Apple had issued guidance instructing them to tell affected users this was a hardware issue that could not be repaired and that their iPhone had to be replaced. However, some in-stock units have also been afflicted with this issue out of the box, leading to an employee stating they were "tired of pulling service stock out of the box, and seeing the exact same problem the customer has on the replacement".[81][82] The issue received mainstream attention in August 2016 when reported by iFixit.[76][79][81] On August 26, 2016, Apple Insider reported based on data from four "high-traffic" Apple Store locations, there was a spike in the number of iPhone 6 devices brought into them for repairs following mainstream reports of the "touch disease" problem.[82]

On August 30, 2016, a group of three iPhone 6 owners sued Apple Inc. in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California and filed for a proposed class action lawsuit, alleging Apple was engaging in unfair business practices by having "long been aware" of the defective design, yet refusing to acknowledge or repair it.[78][83][84]

On November 17, 2016, Apple officially acknowledged the issue and announced a paid repair program for affected iPhone 6 Plus models, stating; "some iPhone 6 Plus devices may exhibit display flickering or Multi-Touch issues after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device".[85]


Sales
--------------------------------------------------
Apple Inc. announced, within 24 hours of availability, over 4 million pre-orders of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were made, exceeding the supply available—an Apple record.[86] 10 million iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus devices were sold in the first three days, marking another Apple record. The iPhone 6S & 6S Plus were introduced in September 2015 selling 13 million units which set the record for sales in the first three days from last years release.[87] Three months after its release, the iPhone 6 generated 71.5 million unit sales.[88]

As of June 2017, the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus have sold 222.4 million units worldwide, making them the most popular iPhone models and the best-selling smartphones of all time.[89][88]

List of iPhone models

The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus[a] are smartphones that were developed and marketed by Apple Inc. They are the tenth generation of the iPhone. They were announced on September 7, 2016, at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco by Apple CEO Tim Cook, and were released on September 16, 2016, succeeding the iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus as the flagship devices in the iPhone series. Apple also released the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in numerous countries worldwide throughout September and October 2016. They were succeeded as flagship devices by the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus[12] on September 12, 2017, and were discontinued with the announcement of the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro on September 10, 2019.

The iPhone 7's overall design is similar to the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S. Changes introduced included new color options (Matte Black and Jet Black), water and dust resistance, a new capacitive, static home button, revised antenna bands, and the controversial removal of the 3.5 mm headphone jack. The device's internal hardware received upgrades, including a heterogeneous quad-core system-on-chip with improved system and graphics performance, upgraded 12 megapixel rear-facing cameras with optical image stabilization on all models, and an additional telephoto lens exclusive to the iPhone 7 Plus to provide enhanced (2x) optical zoom capabilities and portrait mode. The front camera is the first in the series with 1080p (Full HD) video resolution. The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus were supported from iOS 10 to iOS 15, and they are the third to support six versions of iOS before support was terminated, after the iPhone 5s.

The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus were the last iPhones using a quad-core CPU, as well as an aluminum unibody design without wireless charging and a base model starting at 32 GB of internal storage.

The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus were the only iPhones to have a jet black color finish.


History
--------------------------------------------------
Prior to its announcement, multiple aspects of the iPhone 7 were heavily rumoured. Apple's plans to remove the 3.5 mm headphone jack received significant media attention.[b] Other rumors included a flush camera, stereo speakers,[17] a 256 gigabyte storage option, and a larger 3,100 mAh battery.[18]

On August 29, 2016, invitations to a press event at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco, California on September 7, 2016, were sent out to members of the media, prompting immediate speculation of the iPhone 7's upcoming announcement.[19][20] The iPhone 7 was officially announced at that event, with pre-orders beginning September 9, and general availability on September 16.[21][22][23]

The iPhone 7 launched in 30 new countries later in September, with further international rollouts throughout October and November 2016.[c] Indonesia was the last country to release the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, with availability starting on March 31, 2017, following Apple's research and development investment in the country.[31]

On March 21, 2017, Apple announced an iPhone 7 with a red color finish (and white front), as part of its partnership with Product Red to highlight its AIDS fundraising campaign. It launched on March 24, 2017,[32][33] but it was later discontinued after the announcement of the iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X in September 2017 as well as the 256 GB Variant.[34]

On September 12, 2017, Apple announced the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus as direct successors to the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus,[35] alongside the iPhone X.[36]

The iPhone 7 & 7 Plus, as well as the iPhone XS and its Max variant were discontinued and removed from Apple's website after the announcement of the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro on September 10, 2019. They are no longer available for sale.

On June 6, 2022, Apple announced on its website that the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus will not receive support for iOS 16. Controversially, the iPad (5th generation), which has the A9 chip, received iPadOS 16, along with the 6th and 7th generation iPads, which have almost identical hardware to the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus respectively.[37]


Specifications
--------------------------------------------------

Design
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 7's exterior is similar in shape and volume to the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S, although the camera bump is bigger on the iPhone 7. Alongside the existing silver, gold, and rose gold colors, the device is offered in new colors of matte black, glossy "jet black",[21] and, for a limited time, red.[32][33] The "jet black" color is a dark shade, high-gloss black finish. It is created through a multi-step process, beginning with an anodization phase to make the surface of the casing a porous aluminum oxide, and then using a machine to sweep the casing through a powdered compound, absorbed by aluminum oxide. The process is concluded with an "ultrafine particle bath" for additional finishing; the entire process takes less than an hour.[38]


Water protection
--------------------------------------------------
iPhone 7 is rated IP67 water and dust resistant, making it the first officially water-resistant iPhone,[39] although tests have resulted in malfunctions, specifically distorted speakers, after water exposure.[40] The warranty does not cover any water damage to the phone.[41]


Home button
--------------------------------------------------
iPhone 7's home button uses a capacitive mechanism for input rather than a physical push-button, as on previous models, meaning direct skin contact (or a capacitive glove) is required to operate the device.[42][43] Physical feedback is provided via a Taptic Engine vibrator, and the button is also pressure-sensitive.[44] iPhone 7 retains the 3D Touch display system introduced on the iPhone 6S, providing pressure-sensitive touchscreen input.[21]


Headphone plug removal
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are the first iPhones not to feature a 3.5mm headphone jack. It was replaced by a second speaker grille that serves as a vent for the internal barometer.[45] A Lightning-to-3.5-mm-connector adapter, as well as in-ear headphones that use the Lightning connector, were bundled with the device,[21] and the adapter is also sold separately as an accessory.[46] The adapter is also compatible with other iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch devices running iOS 10 and newer.[47]


Hardware
--------------------------------------------------

Chipsets
--------------------------------------------------
iPhone 7 uses the Apple A10 Fusion 64-bit system-on-chip, which consists of two low-power cores and two high-power cores (only two cores are used at any point in time[48]). The A10 chip also features a hexa-core graphics chip capable of "console-level gaming".[49] As with prior models, iPhone 7 is available in two sizes: one with a 4.7 in (120 mm) screen, and a "Plus" variant with a 5.5 in (140 mm) screen.[50] The displays have identical sizes and resolutions to iPhone 6S, but with a wider color gamut[21] and increased brightness.[51] The screen-to-body ratio is about ~66% and ~68% for the 7 and 7 Plus, respectively.[52][53]

Both device variants also contain a new iteration of Apple's motion coprocessor, the M10.[54] Unlike previous iPhone models, internal storage options for iPhone 7 begin at 32 GB instead of 16 GB, and max out at 256 GB.[55] iPhone 7 Plus offers 3 GB of RAM, more than any other previous iPhone;[48] the 4.7-inch iPhone 7 has 2 GB.[56]


Cameras
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 7 includes a 12-megapixel rear-facing camera with a quad-LED "True Tone" flash; its aperture was widened to f/1.8, and the standard-size phone model adds optical image stabilization – a feature that was previously exclusive to Plus models.[57]

The iPhone 7 Plus includes a second 12-megapixel telephoto lens, which can be used to achieve 2× optical zoom, and up to 10× digital zoom. However, the telephoto camera has an f/2.8 aperture and lacks optical image stabilization.[58]

The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus record video with single-channel mono audio.[59]

Still photos with 6.5 megapixels (3412×1920) can be captured during video recording.[60]

The front-facing camera was upgraded to a 7-megapixel sensor with automatic image stabilization.[21][61]

The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are the first iPhones to be able to record 1080p video using the front camera.[62]


Battery life
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 7 has a 1,960 mAh battery which can last about 3–5 hours. The iPhone 7 Plus has 2,900 mAh battery and can last for 5–8 hours.


Software
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 7 originally shipped with iOS 10 pre-installed.[63] The iPhone 7 Plus received an exclusive portrait camera mode in the iOS 10.1 software update.[64] This camera mode is capable of producing a bokeh effect using depth of field analysis of the second camera of dual-lens in the back of iPhone 7 Plus. Mainstream software support for the iPhone 7 was dropped when iOS 16 was released.[65][66] But, it still receives iOS 15 security updates (as of January 22, 2024). The current version of iOS to support iPhone 7 is iOS 15.8.3.[67] The device can also run Android 10 unofficially via a project called Project Sandcastle made by Corellium, a security research company that produces paid iOS, Android, and IoT emulators.[68] Ubuntu 20.04 "Focal Fossa" has also been ported via Project Sandcastle.[69]


Accessories
--------------------------------------------------
Each iPhone 7 originally came with a Lightning-to-3.5-mm adapter,[21] although this was omitted starting on September 12, 2018.[70] Apple sells the adapter independently as well.[46] iPhone 7 does not have a built-in DAC, a Cirrus Logic CS4272 DAC is included as part of the adapter. Apple also unveiled several Bluetooth wireless headphones ostensibly intended for use with the iPhone 7, including AirPods, wireless in-ear headphones, and three new Beats headphone products. All four products utilize an in-house wireless chip known as the Apple W1, which is designed to provide low-power Bluetooth operation and integration with iOS and macOS devices (though they are still compatible with other Bluetooth-supported devices).[71][72]


Reception
--------------------------------------------------
Reception of the iPhone 7 was mixed. Although reviewers noted improvements to the camera, especially the dual rear camera on the Plus model, the phone was criticized for the lack of innovation in its build quality. Many reviews panned the removal of the 3.5 mm headphone jack; some critics argued that the change was meant to bolster licensing of the proprietary Lightning connector and the sales of Apple's own wireless headphone products, and questioned the effects of the change on audio quality. Apple was also mocked by critics for Phil Schiller's statement that such a drastic change required "courage".

Gordon Kelly of Forbes noted that rival smartphones, such as the Samsung Galaxy S7, had increased battery life and added water resistance over its predecessor while retaining the headphone jack, and that the iPhone 7's camera photo quality was improved but still lagging behind some phones already on the market, including the Galaxy S7 and Nexus 6P. Kelly praised how Apple was able to extract improved brightness and accurate color reproduction from its LCD display panel, while noting that it was old technology which was also well behind rivals who had already moved to sharper 1080p or even 2K screens. The iPhone 7's exterior, which reuses the aging design of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S, was criticized, especially the size of the device and thick top/bottom bezels, with Kelly writing that "the iPhone 7 Plus is simply far too big for a smartphone with a 5.5-inch display".[73]

Nilay Patel of The Verge described the device as being "full of aggressive breaks from convention," noting the headphone jack removal, heterogeneous CPU, and home button redesign, going as far as dubbing it "a prototype of next year's rumored drastic iPhone redesign disguised as an iPhone 6." The display quality was considered an improvement over previous models, albeit "not as insane" as the quad HD displays on competing phones. The Taptic Engine was considered the "first really valuable new UI concept I've seen on phones in years" (as opposed to the "gimmick" of 3D Touch), Patel felt that the cameras of the devices were a step above the 6S in terms of performance, and praised the dual-lens camera on the 7 Plus for enhancing the phone's camera functionality. However, he panned the lack of editing features that made use of them. In regards to the enhanced Bluetooth audio support provided by devices containing the W1 chip, he argued that Apple "took away an established open standard in favor of new technologies, but instead of making the experience of using those new technologies better across the board, it made every third-party wireless audio product a second-class citizen of the Apple ecosystem." Giving the iPhone 7 a 9 out of 10, he concluded that the devices were "legitimately among the most interesting, opinionated, powerful phones Apple has ever shipped, and the most confident expressions of the company's vision in a long time. iOS 10 is excellent, the cameras are better, and the performance is phenomenal. And the batteries last longer."[74]

John McCann of TechRadar wrote that for the first time, the phablet-sized iPhone 7 Plus was "markedly better" than the smaller model. He highlighted improved battery life and praised the camera, calling the Plus' dual cameras "excellent" for point-and-shoot, and "much improved" for low-light performance. McCann wrote that the lack of a headphone jack was "initially frustrating", but noted that it was a "positive step forward for the mobile industry", despite the "short-term effects ... making the most noise for now".[75]


Headphone jack controversy
--------------------------------------------------
Criticism of the iPhone 7 centered around the removal of the headphone jack, including the inability to use wired headphones with the included adapter and charge the device simultaneously.[d][77]

In a particularly scathing article, Nilay Patel of The Verge wrote that removing the headphone jack, "a deeply established standard" as he put it, would be "user-hostile and stupid". He goes on to list reasons why removing the port is negative, concluding with "No one is asking for this" and "Vote with your dollars".[78]

Gordon Kelly of Forbes noted that wireless audio technology was immature at the moment, with Bluetooth audio quality being inferior and Lightning's audio reliability still in question. The removal of the headphone jack meant that in Patel's words, "You're being pushed into an era where you will have to pay more for decent headphones due to their need for an integrated DAC and/or Lightning licensing", and pointed out that "the only company to profit from this situation is Apple, who will now be charging licensing fees to millions of headphone companies".[73]

In particular, Apple's vice president Phil Schiller, who announced the change, was mocked extensively online for stating that removing the headphone jack took 'courage'.[79][80] An online petition created by the consumer group SumOfUs, that accuses Apple of planned obsolescence and causing substantial electronic waste by removing the headphone jack,[81] reached over 300,000 signatures.[82]


Issues
--------------------------------------------------

Hissing noises
--------------------------------------------------
Some users have reported a strange hissing noise during heavy usage of the phone. CNET reports it as "faint buzzes and hums coming from the backside".[83] The Daily Telegraph speculates that the iPhone 7's new A10 Fusion processor is the source of the noise, linking to tweets that compare the phone's hissing sound to "hearing the fans spin up loudly whenever your Mac's CPU gets used to its actual potential."[84]


Performance differences
--------------------------------------------------
The Guardian reported in October 2016 that storage tests from Unbox Therapy and GSMArena showed that the 32 GB iPhone 7 is "significantly" slower than the 128 and 256 GB versions, measuring data write speeds of 341 MB/s on a 128 GB iPhone 7 model versus 42 MB/s on a 32 GB model.[85] October 2016 network tests by Cellular Insights showed that models A1660 and A1661 with Qualcomm modems had "a significant performance edge" over models A1778 and A1784 with Intel modems. Inspection of the modems also found that the Qualcomm version's ability to use Ultra HD Voice had been turned off, likely to "level the playing field between the Qualcomm, and Intel variants". The report concluded with the statement that "We are not sure what was the main reason behind Apple's decision to source two different modem suppliers for the newest iPhone".[86][87] Bloomberg reported in November 2016 that tests by researchers from Twin Prime and Cellular Insights had shown the two modems to perform similarly on some U.S. cellular networks despite one of the modems being technically capable of faster connectivity. Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller told the publication that "Every iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus meets or exceeds all of Apple's wireless performance standards, quality metrics, and reliability testing ... In all of our rigorous lab tests based on wireless industry standards, in thousands of hours of real-world field testing, and in extensive carrier partner testing, the data shows there is no discernible difference in the wireless performance of any of the models". Bloomberg quoted analysts and technology advisers who stated that "[Apple] don't want one version to get the reputation that it is better" and that "This may not impact the fanboys, but it may make other consumers think twice about buying an Apple phone, especially if they think they might be purchasing a sub-standard product".[88]


Perception of slogan in Cantonese-speaking regions
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 7's "This is 7" slogan has been misunderstood when translated to certain other languages.[89][90] The phone's slogan in Mainland China is "7, is here;" (Chinese: 7，在此; pinyin: 7, zài cǐ), while in Hong Kong, its slogan is, "This, is iPhone 7;" (Chinese: 這，就是iPhone 7; Jyutping: ze5, zau6 si6 iPhone 7).

In Cantonese, the local language of Hong Kong, the slogan could be mistakenly interpreted as "This is penis". "Tsat", (Chinese: 杘; Jyutping: cat6), is a common slang term for an erect penis, and "seven", (Chinese: 七; Jyutping: cat1), which varies only in tone, is often used as a euphemism.[citation needed]


Replacing the home button
--------------------------------------------------
In the iPhone 7, Apple added a software lock that prevents individuals from attempting to replace the home button on their own. Users are now required to go to an Apple Store to have repairs done, with "recalibration" of the button being necessary. This is a step further than Apple went with iPhone 5S, 6 and 6S, where only Touch ID functionality would get disabled but the "return-to-home" functionality still worked.[91][92]


Failure to connect to cellular service
--------------------------------------------------
Some iPhone 7 devices with the model numbers A1660, A1779 and A1780 suffer from a problem where they show a "No service" message even when cellular reception is available. Apple will repair those devices for free within four years of the first retail sale of the unit.[93]


Loop disease
--------------------------------------------------
Some iPhone 7 devices suffer from a problem that affects audio in the device. Users reported a grayed-out speaker button during calls, grayed-out voice memo icon, and occasional freezing of the device. A few users also complained that lightning EarPods failed to work with the device and that the Wi-Fi button would be grayed out after restarting the iPhone. On May 4, 2018, Apple acknowledged the issue through an internal memo. If an affected iPhone 7 was no longer covered by warranty, Apple said its service providers could request an exception for this particular issue. The exemptions abruptly ended in July 2018 when Apple deleted the internal document. Many customers have complained Apple has charged customers around $350 to fix the issue. Many customers complain the issue first appeared after a software update.


Sales
--------------------------------------------------
Apple has deliberately withheld pre-order sales numbers, citing that these are "no longer a representative metric for our investors and customers".[94] Without releasing specific numbers, T-Mobile US stated that the iPhone 7 had broken the carrier's all-time record for first-day pre-order sales. The following weekend, T-Mobile US stated that iPhone 7 was its biggest iPhone launch ever, being "up nearly 4x compared to the next most popular iPhone".[95]

On September 14, 2016, two days before the iPhone 7 went on sale, Apple announced that due to high demand, they had sold out of all "jet black" iPhone 7's, and all colors of the iPhone 7 Plus.[96] This caused issues for customers in the iPhone Upgrade Program, who were unable to reserve new phones.[97] After customer complaints and a class action lawsuit,[98] Apple made changes to ensure members of the program could get new phones as soon as possible.[99]

In May 2017, analytics research company Strategy Analytics announced that iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus were the best-selling smartphones worldwide during the first quarter of 2017, selling 21.5 million and 17.4 million units, respectively.[100][101]


US carrier trade-in deals
--------------------------------------------------
For the initial U.S. sales of the iPhone 7, all four major wireless carriers announced trade-in deals. Under the deals, the monthly installment plan cost of the iPhone 7 is negated by a monthly credit on consumers' bill, but consumers who cancel their service with the carrier or pay off the phone prior to the installment contract completion will not receive credits for the remaining months.[102] Jacob Kastrenakes of The Verge noted that the deals effectively constituted a return to two-year phone contracts, in which the deals "essentially lock you into that carrier for two years".[103]

In the wake of these deals, Verizon announced they had seen an increase in sales over the release of the previous year's iPhone 6S, AT&T said that sales had exceeded its expectations, and T-Mobile and Sprint announced "huge increases in sales", with T-Mobile seeing a demand roughly four times higher for the 7 than the 6.[104]


Reports about trimmed production
--------------------------------------------------
In December 2016, DigiTimes reported that Apple had reduced production of the iPhone 7 because of decreasing demand for the product after the initial surge of interest waned. A reason cited was consumers and suppliers turning their attention to next year's iPhone model.[105][106]

A new report from Nikkei at the end of December included details on sales and production of the iPhone 7. The report, "based on data from suppliers", stated that Apple would trim production of the iPhone 7 by 10% in the first quarter of 2017, following "sluggish" sales. Nikkei reported that Apple previously trimmed production of the iPhone 7 by 20% due to accumulated inventory of the previous model, but that the new models had "sold more sluggishly than expected". Additionally, the report notes that the "iPhone 7 Plus, which features two cameras on its back face, remains popular", but "a shortage of camera sensors has curbed Apple's ability to meet demand for the phones".[107]

List of iPhone models

The iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus are smartphones developed and marketed by Apple Inc. They are the eleventh generation of the iPhone. The iPhone 8 was released on September 22, 2017, succeeding the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, respectively.[9]

The designs of the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus are largely similar to that of their predecessors except for the addition of a glass back. The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus were the final flagship iPhone models to feature the home button and Touch ID. Notable changes include the removal of the rose gold and jet black color variants,[10] addition of inductive charging, a faster processor, and improved cameras and displays. The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus share most of their internal hardware with the iPhone X.

The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus were discontinued as of February 2020, having sold 86.3 million units worldwide, making them one of the best-selling smartphones of all time.[11][12][original research?] They initially shipped with iOS 11 and supported up to iOS 16, and do not support iOS 17.[13]

The second and third generations of the entry level iPhone SE retain the iPhone 8's exterior dimensions and Touch ID, with upgraded hardware.


History
--------------------------------------------------
Apple invited the press to a media event at the Steve Jobs Theater in the Apple Park campus on September 12, 2017.[14] The iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus were announced at that event, and released on September 22, 2017.[15]

On April 9, 2018, Apple introduced an iPhone 8 with a red color finish and a black front, in support of their partnership with Product Red and their AIDS fundraising campaign.[16]

In November 2018, just over a year from initial release, Apple started selling refurbished iPhone 8 models starting at $499.[17] The price was lowered to US$319.[18] Refurbished iPhone 8 Plus models were available starting at $599.[19] The price was also subsequently lowered to US$469 and later to $359.[20]

On April 15, 2020, Apple announced the second-generation iPhone SE and discontinued the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, which share the external form factor but has upgraded internals including an A13 Bionic processor.[21][22] On March 8, 2022, Apple announced the third-generation iPhone SE with the same exterior dimensions, but with an upgraded camera and Apple's A15 processor.


Specifications
--------------------------------------------------

Hardware
--------------------------------------------------

Display
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus retain the Retina HD Display found in the iPhone 7,[23] but they now feature True Tone technology, allowing for automatic screen adjustments based on surrounding ambient lighting.[15] They can play HDR10 and Dolby Vision content despite not having an HDR-ready display, done by down-converting the HDR content to fit the display while still having some enhancements to dynamic range, contrast, and wide color gamut compared to standard content.[24]


Camera
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus feature a 12 MP camera with autofocus, f/1.8 aperture and optical image stabilization capable of capturing 4K video at 24, 30, or 60 frames per second, or 1080p video at 30, 60, 120 or 240 frames per second,[25] and a Quad LED True Tone Flash with Slow Sync.[26] The Slow Sync flash, 4K 60fps, and 1080p 240 fps options are new features for the 8 and 8 Plus, over the options available on the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus.

The iPhone 8 Plus, like the iPhone 7 Plus, adds a second, telephoto, lens. A new AI-driven option is available for the iPhone 8 Plus, called Portrait Lighting--making use of the more capable image signal processor in the A11 SoC.[26]

Both models have a 7 MP front camera with an f/2.2 aperture capable of capturing 1080p video at 30 frames per second and 720p video at 24 frames per second, along with face detection and high-dynamic range.[25][27]

The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus record videos with single channel audio (mono).[28]

Still photos with 6.5 megapixels (3412×1920) can be captured during video recording.[29]


Chipset
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus contain the Apple A11 Bionic system-on-chip, a hexa-core processor that the company says features two performance cores that are 25% faster than those found in the iPhone 7's A10 processor and four efficiency cores that are 70% faster than those in the prior model. The phones also feature an Apple-designed graphics processing unit 30% faster than prior units, with the same level of performance as the A10 at half the power.[15]


Other
--------------------------------------------------
The phones have glass backs instead of the complete aluminum housing found on prior models, enabling the use of Qi inductive charging.[15] The phones are rated IP67 for water resistance and dust resistance. [30] Both models come with 64, 128, and 256 gigabytes storage options,[31][32] and are offered in silver, gold, or Space Gray color options.[15] A Product Red special edition version in red with a black front was released on April 9, 2018.[16] The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus were the last iPhones with white front in Silver and Gold colors.

In addition to Qi wireless charging, the iPhone 8 also supports wired charging using Apple's proprietary Lightning connector. It can fast-charge from a charger providing USB Power Delivery combined with a special USB-C to Lightning adapter cable supporting fast charging.[33]

The iPhone 8 has a 6 out of 10 reparability score from iFixit, mainly due to the use of excessive glue for the back glass.[34]


Software
--------------------------------------------------
Both the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus were supplied with iOS 11 on launch,[25][27] and support iOS 12, iOS 13, iOS 14, iOS 15 and iOS 16. Apple announced that the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, as well as the iPhone X, would not support iOS 17 due to hardware limitations.[35] However, the devices still receive security updates.


Reception
--------------------------------------------------
Reception of the phones was generally positive, with reviewers praising the addition of inductive charging, fast charge capability, and the new Apple A11 processor, while criticizing the aging design that was introduced with the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in 2014.

Samuel Axon of Ars Technica called the A11 processor "a marvelous feat of engineering", writing that it offers "industry-leading performance". Axon also praised the cameras, writing that "The colors are great, and low light performance is very good for a smartphone".[36] Chris Velazco of Engadget praised the speed of the A11 processor, the build quality and the "excellent" camera, while criticizing design familiarities with previous iPhone generations and limited water-protection levels compared to competitors.[37]

John McCann of TechRadar enjoyed the feel of the glass back despite criticizing the phone's overall design. McCann also praised the camera and called inductive charging a "useful" addition to the iPhone lineup.[38]

David Pierce of Wired similarly stated that the iPhone 8 models were overshadowed by the iPhone X, despite calling them "virtually perfect phones". Pierce praised performance, cameras, and displays, while repeatedly criticizing the "outdated" design.[39]

Nilay Patel of The Verge called the iPhone 8 the "default option", noting that the 8 models stand as almost universally overlooked by Apple's other new iPhone launched, the iPhone X. He nevertheless praised the device's form factor for being easy and non-slippery to hold and the display's addition of True Tone technology and upgraded speakers, though he cited issues with inductive charging speed through wireless pads as well as the price of the iPhone 8 Plus 256 GB, which was close to that of the iPhone X. Patel also criticized the iPhone 8's aging design, dating back to the iPhone 6 released in 2014; the most notable critique was of the thick bezels when compared to other 2017 smartphones, designed with nearly bezel-less faces to incorporate larger screens in a similar form factor.[40]

The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus were also criticized for their durability, as drop tests performed showed that the rear glass is not "the most durable glass ever in a smartphone", as claimed by Apple.[41][42]

Camera testing company DxOMark gave the camera on the iPhone 8 a rating of 92 and 8 Plus a rating of 94, giving them the title of best smartphone cameras tested by the company.[43][44] The Samsung Galaxy Note 8 later matched the iPhone 8 Plus with an identical overall score of 94.[45][46] They were later overtaken by the Google Pixel 2, which scored a 98 rating.[47]

Although being the first mobile phone to record 2160p at 60 frames per second, the iPhone 8, 8 Plus and X have been criticized in a review by GSMArena for its mono (single-channel) audio recording for videos, while stereo audio recording for videos has been available on competing mobile phone models for several years, such as the Samsung Galaxy S3 and Sony Xperia S from 2012.[28][48][49]


Issues
--------------------------------------------------
On August 31, 2018, Apple announced that a "very small percentage" of iPhone 8 devices released between September 2017 and March 2018 contained a manufacturing defect in the logic board. This fault affected iPhone 8 models sold in Australia, China, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Macau, New Zealand, and the United States. Defective devices may experience unexpected reboots, a frozen or unresponsive screen, or may fail to turn on. Users with an affected device, as determined by their serial number, can have their device replaced for free by Apple. This issue does not affect the iPhone 8 Plus.[50][51]

List of iPhone models

The iPhone 11 is a smartphone developed and marketed by Apple Inc. It is the thirteenth generation of iPhone, succeeding the iPhone XR, and was unveiled on September 10, 2019, alongside the higher-end iPhone 11 Pro at the Steve Jobs Theater in Apple Park, Cupertino, by Apple CEO Tim Cook. Preorders began on September 13, 2019, and the phone was officially released on September 20, 2019, one day after the official public release of iOS 13.

Despite minimal exterior changes from the preceding iPhone XR, substantial design changes within the phone took place, including the addition of the more powerful Apple A13 Bionic chip as well as an ultra-wide dual-camera system.[9] In October 2020, Apple halted the inclusion of both Apple EarPods and the wall adapter, citing environmental goals.[10][11]

As of March 2022[update], the iPhone 11 has sold 159.2 million units worldwide, making it the tenth best-selling smartphone of all time.[12][13]

The iPhone 11 as well as the iPhone 12 mini and iPhone 13 Pro with its Max variant were discontinued and removed from Apple's website after the announcement of the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro on September 7, 2022.


History
--------------------------------------------------
Details regarding the smartphone were widely leaked before the official release; complete specifications and renderings of the phone were widely publicized. Among the most significant changes were improvements in the cameras and the continuation of the 'notch' design around the frontal camera which dipped down into the screen, a feature started by the iPhone X.[14][15][16] The official event invite which was sent out to developers contained a graphic featuring an Apple logo made of layered colored glass, implied to be the new colors for the phone. A patent filed by Apple earlier in the year also hinted at a new camera design.[17][18]


Design
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 11 was available in six colors: Purple, Yellow, Green, Black, White and Product (Red). The top of the screen retains the 'notch' design, wherein the TrueDepth camera system and phone speaker are encapsulated in a black, rounded-out rectangle that dips into the screen, similar to its predecessor, the iPhone XR. An elevated area in the top corner on the back of the iPhone acts as a camera housing, containing the microphone, the flashlight, and both of the rear-facing digital cameras.[11][19] The Apple logo on the back of the phone is centered to be equidistant to all edges and is made of a reflective material.


Specifications
--------------------------------------------------

Hardware
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 11, along with the iPhone 11 Pro, uses Apple's A13 Bionic processor, which contains a third-generation neural engine. It has three internal storage options: 64 GB, 128 GB, and 256 GB.[20] It also has 4 GB of RAM.[21] The iPhone 11 has an IP68 water- and dust-resistant rating along with dirt and grime, and is water-resistant up to 2 m (6.6 ft) for 30 minutes. However, the manufacturer's warranty does not cover liquid damage to the phone. Also, like previous iPhones, both phones do not have a headphone jack, and initially came with wired EarPods with a Lightning connector, although Apple no longer includes these with any device.[11][21] The iPhone 11 is the first smartphone with built-in ultra wideband hardware, via its Apple U1 chip.[22][23][24]


Display
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 11 has a 6.1-inch (15 cm) IPS LCD with a resolution of 1792 × 828 pixels (1.4 megapixels) at a pixel density of 326 PPI with a maximum brightness of 625 nits and a 1400:1 contrast ratio and it is equivalent to the iPhone XR. It supports Dolby Vision, HDR10, True-Tone, and a wide color gamut. As with the iPhone 11 Pro, XR, XS, and X, the display has a notch at the top for the TrueDepth camera system and the speaker. The display has an oleophobic coating, making it fingerprint-resistant.[2][21] Apple announced in September 2019 that both the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro would show a warning notification if a display were replaced with an unauthorized part. Apple stated that problems with the phone could arise if the wrong parts or procedures were used during the repair process.[25]


Battery
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 11 is supplied with a 11.91 Wh (3,110 mAh) battery, a slight increase from the 11.21 Wh (2,942 mAh) found in the iPhone XR. The battery is not user-replaceable.


Camera
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 11 includes a dual-lens 12 MP rear camera array. It has one ƒ/2.4 ultra-wide-angle lens with a 120° field of view and 2× optical zoom out, and one ƒ/1.8 wide-angle lens. The iPhone 11 supports 4K video at up to 60 fps and 1080p slow motion at up to 240 fps.[2] The phone also features an audio zoom feature, which focuses audio on the area on which is being zoomed in, similar to the Pro model.[21] Both of the cameras support video, although only the primary lens has OIS. It supports portrait mode with six portrait lighting effects, depth control, and an advanced bokeh effect. The phone also has an automatic night mode allowing the camera to take brighter pictures with reduced noise in low-light environments. Also, a redesigned camera app adds new features such as a scroll wheel for choosing between the different lenses and a feature called "QuickTake", which allows the user to long-press the shutter button to take a video. Apple has also announced a new Deep Fusion feature that takes advantage of AI and machine learning for image processing and was released via iOS 13.2 software update on October 29, 2019.[2][21][26]


Software
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 11 was supplied with iOS 13,[27] which includes Siri, Face ID (through the TrueDepth camera), Apple Pay, and Apple Card support. It received iOS 14 on September 16, 2020, iOS 15 on September 20, 2021, iOS 16 on September 12, 2022, iOS 17 on September 18, 2023.[28] and iOS 18 on September 16, 2024.[29]


Reception
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 11 drew generally positive reviews after its launch.[27][30] Reviews generally praised the phone's performance, battery life, and cameras, while criticizing the display as passable, but aging quickly. Reviewers also criticized the notch as being far too large for 2019. According to Counterpoint Research's Market Pulse, it was the second best-selling and the most popular model globally for 2019, in less than four months of launch.[31]


Controversy
--------------------------------------------------

Removal of the power adapter and EarPods
--------------------------------------------------
Apple, through an environmental initiative, has removed the EarPods and power adapter from new iPhone boxes starting October 2020, including the iPhone 11. Removing these items is claimed to reduce e-waste and permit a smaller iPhone box, allowing more devices to be transported simultaneously to decrease carbon footprint. However, Apple now includes a USB-C to Lightning cable, incompatible with the existing USB-A power adapters that Apple previously supplied with their devices. Upgraders can still use their existing iPhone power adapters and cables, but users wanting fast charging capabilities will have to purchase a USB-C power adapter separately.[32]

List of iPhone models

The iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Mini (stylized and marketed as iPhone 12 mini) are smartphones developed and marketed by Apple Inc. They are the fourteenth-generation iPhones, succeeding the iPhone 11.[19] They were unveiled at a virtually held Apple Special Event at Apple Park in Cupertino, California, on October 13, 2020, alongside the "premium flagship" iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max and HomePod Mini. Pre-orders for the iPhone 12 started on October 16, 2020, and the phone was released in most countries on October 23, 2020, alongside the iPhone 12 Pro and fourth-generation iPad Air. Pre-orders for the iPhone 12 Mini began on November 6, 2020, and the phone was released on November 13, 2020, alongside the iPhone 12 Pro Max.[20]

The major upgrades over the iPhone 11[21] include the addition of a Super Retina XDR OLED as opposed to the Liquid Retina LED-backlit LCD IPS panel on the iPhone 11 and XR, 5G support, the introduction of MagSafe, Apple A14 Bionic system on a chip (SoC) and high-dynamic-range video Dolby Vision 4K up to 30 fps.[22] The iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Mini, like the iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max, are the first iPhone models from Apple to no longer include a power adapter or EarPods headphones found in prior iPhone models; however, a USB-C to Lightning cable is included; this change was retroactively applied to other iPhone models sold by Apple, such as the iPhone XR, iPhone 11 and the second-generation iPhone SE.


Design
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 12 and 12 Mini is the first major redesign since the iPhone X. It features a chassis with flat edges, similar to the iPhone 4 and iPhone 5 designs, as well as the iPad Pro since 2018, and the 4th-generation iPad Air, which was also released in 2020. The notch size is similar to previous iPhone models, despite speculation about a reduction in width.[23] The borders around the display are thinner by 35% than any previous model. The new design also comes with a ceramic-hardened front glass, marketed as Ceramic Shield, while the back retains the previous generation Dual-Ion Exchange strengthened glass.[24]

On April 20, 2021, at Apple's Special Event “Spring Loaded”, Apple revealed a new purple color option which became available on April 30, 2021.[25]

The iPhone 12 and 12 Mini are available in six colors: Black, White, Product Red, Green, Blue, and Purple.[24]


Specifications
--------------------------------------------------

Hardware
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Mini use Apple's six-core A14 Bionic processor, which contains a next-generation neural engine. They both have three internal storage options: 64, 128, and 256 GB.[a] Both also carry an IP68 water and dust resistance rating along with dirt and grime, and is water-resistant up to six meters (20 feet) for 30 minutes. However, the manufacturer warranty does not cover liquid damage to the phone.

The iPhone 12 series are the first iPhone models to be supplied from launch without EarPods or a wall adapter, which Apple says was done to reduce carbon emissions and waste since most users already own them. Apple also claims 70% more boxes can fit on a pallet given the smaller box, and thus further reducing emissions.[26] A USB-C to Lightning cord is still included. This change also applies retroactively to all other iPhone models still in production.[27] To comply with French law regarding wireless device radiation and health which requires phones to be bundled with and promote use of hands-free accessories by children under 14, iPhone models will still include EarPods in this market.[28]

A magnetic connector known as MagSafe is introduced on the iPhone 12 models, allowing accessories such as cases and charging cords to be attached to the rear of the device. Accessories can also be stacked together.[29]

The devices support 5G cellular communications. This allows upload speeds of up to 200 Mbit/s and download speeds of up to 4 Gbit/s.[30] However, only models sold in the U.S. support the fastest mmWave technology; those sold elsewhere in the world, including Canada, support only sub-6 GHz frequency bands.[31] A new feature called Smart Data Mode enables 5G only when necessary to preserve battery life.[32]


Displays
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 12 features a 6.1-inch (155 mm) display[33] with Super Retina XDR OLED technology at a resolution of 2532 × 1170 pixels and a pixel density of about 460 ppi.[34] The iPhone 12 Mini features a 5.4-inch (137 mm) display with the same technology at a resolution of 2340 × 1080 pixels, and a pixel density of about 476 ppi. Both phones have a peak brightness of 1200 nits when viewing HDR content equivalent to the iPhone 12 Pro, and normal brightness of 625 nits.[34] Both phones also use an improved glass-ceramic covering called Ceramic Shield which is co-developed with Corning Inc. Apple describes it as having "4 times better drop performance" and being "tougher than any smartphone glass".[35]


Batteries
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 12 has a 10.78 Wh (2,815 mAh) battery, a slight decrease from the 11.91 Wh (3,110 mAh) battery found in the iPhone 11 and identical to the battery found in the iPhone 12 Pro. The iPhone 12 Mini has a 8.57 Wh (2,227 mAh) battery. Like previous iPhones, the battery is not user-replaceable.[36]


Chipsets
--------------------------------------------------
Both the iPhone 12 and 12 Mini have the Apple A14 Bionic, the first ARM-based smartphone system-on-a-chip (SoC) manufactured on the 5 nm process node. However, unlike previous years, they are not the first Apple devices to receive the newest A-series processor, with the fourth-generation iPad Air being the first. Both phones use Qualcomm's Snapdragon X55 5G modem.


Cameras
--------------------------------------------------
Both phones have two rear 12-megapixel cameras: wide and ultra-wide. The wide camera is a 26 mm full-frame equivalent with an f/1.6 aperture which captures 27% more light than the f/1.8 aperture in the iPhone 11[20] and a seven-element lens. The ultra-wide camera is a 13 mm full-frame equivalent with an f/2.4 aperture and a five-element lens.[37]

All cameras now support Night Mode for both photo and time-lapse video at full resolution.[24] Smart HDR has been improved thanks to Smart HDR 3.[37] This iPhone model is the first capable of shooting 10-bit high dynamic range Dolby Vision 4K video at up to 30 fps which allows for greater brightness and deeper shadows.[38]

The front-facing, TrueDepth camera features a 12-megapixel camera with an f/2.2 aperture. This model also added Night Mode to the front-facing camera.[24]

Sensors

The iPhone 12 and 12 Mini include mostly the same sensors found on prior iPhone models going back to the iPhone X. These include an accelerometer, gyroscope, barometer, proximity sensor, ambient light sensor, and a digital compass. The devices also include the Face ID sensor for biometric authentication.


Software
--------------------------------------------------
Both phones originally shipped with iOS 14.[24] The devices come with the stock iOS apps, such as Safari, Weather, and Messages, and they include Siri, the personal assistant in iOS. They received iOS 15 on September 20, 2021, iOS 16 on September 12, 2022, iOS 17 on September 18, 2023, and most recently, iOS 18 on September 16, 2024.[39]


Reception
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 12 received largely positive reviews. The Verge called it a "beautiful, powerful, and incredibly capable device", praising the new design reminiscent of the iPhone 5, the speed of the A14 Bionic processor, its 5G capabilities, addition of the OLED display like on the high end iPhones, combined with much slimmer bezels than previous iPhone models and improved battery life over iPhone 11.[40] Engadget also gave the iPhone 12 a positive review, praising the MagSafe wireless charging and accessories magnetic attachment as well as the redesigned camera system, a greatly improved display like in its Pro counterparts.[41]

iPhone 12 was the third best-selling and was the most popular model globally in Q2 2021.[42]

Apple was criticized for the continued reliance on Face ID as the sole biometric option to unlock the device, which is incompatible with face masks. iOS 14.5 allowed the use of a paired Apple Watch to unlock the phone while wearing a mask, while iOS 15.4 allows unlocking with a mask on, without an Apple Watch. The third-generation iPhone SE is the only iPhone currently produced by Apple that supports Touch ID, an alternative unlocking option that is compatible with face masks. All models can still use a passcode to log in.[43][44][45][46]

The iPhone 12 mini has received more mixed reviews. Some praised the phone for being a new small phone, while others criticized the price and inferior battery life compared to the full-size 12[47] (although the battery life of the iPhone 12 mini is longer than that of the second-generation iPhone SE[48]).


"OLED-gate"
--------------------------------------------------
Within two weeks after its public release, a thread was started at Apple Support Communities describing a problem with the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro OLED panel black pixels not shutting off completely in black scenes, resulting in what was described as "ugly glowing".[49] A considerable number of users have since posted replies reporting the same problem, photos and videos have been shared online demonstrating the issue. As of January 2021, Apple has not yet made an official statement.


EarPods and power adapter controversy
--------------------------------------------------
Apple no longer includes either EarPods or a power adapter in the boxes of all iPhone 12 and 12 Pro models, claiming that it is an environmental initiative and no longer including them would reduce e-waste and permit smaller iPhone boxes, allowing more devices to be transported simultaneously to decrease its carbon footprint. The boxes only include a USB-C to Lightning cable, incompatible with the existing USB-A power adapters that Apple previously supplied with its devices. Users can still use their existing USB-A power adapters and cables but must purchase a USB-C power adapter sold separately to enable fast charging.

The iPhone 12 was sold in France with EarPods as the law required that smartphones be bundled with “hands-free kits” or a “headset” in order to protect children aged 14 and younger from electromagnetic radiation.[50][51]

In December 2020, a Brazilian consumer rights watchdog Procon-SP Foundation requested Apple to provide proof that not including chargers is beneficial to the environment. The watchdog argues that Apple removing the charger is harming consumers and wants to force the company to include one as it claims the charger is an essential component.[52]

The Verge reported the reason power adapters and EarPods are no longer included could be to offset the increased cost of 5G components. These new components are reported to cost 30% more than their predecessors.[53]


Repairability concerns
--------------------------------------------------
iFixit and Australian YouTuber Hugh Jeffreys discovered that a number of key components such as the cameras would malfunction or display warnings if they are replaced with new ones or those taken from an otherwise identical donor unit.[54] Internal Apple documents also mention that, beginning with the iPhone 12 and in subsequent models, authorized technicians would have to run the phones through an internal System Configuration tool to reprogram repaired units in order to account for hardware changes. While Apple has yet to comment on the issue, the inability to replace key system components have raised concerns about right to repair and planned obsolescence.[55] However, the iPhone 12 Mini does not have this issue.[56] Apple later addressed the issue with the release of iOS 14.4, which displays a warning message if the phone detects an unpaired camera module but otherwise allows for full functionality.[57]


Electromagnetic radiation concerns
--------------------------------------------------
In September 2023, the French watchdog agency Agence nationale des fréquences [fr] notified Apple that sales of the iPhone 12 must be halted in France due to the device exceeding the legal specific absorption rate for consumer electronics. The agency also requested that Apple must recall all iPhone 12s that have been produced in order to meet safety regulations. However, this coincided with the release of the iPhone 15 models where Apple also discontinued the iPhone 12 globally.[58]

Despite the move however, France's digital minister did emphasize the iPhone 12's radiation levels[59] remained well below the threshold deemed harmful by scientific studies. Even Apple, "...disputed the findings and said the device complies with regulations..." [Regulations | source 39]. This highlighted a discrepancy between the agency's tests and real-world phone usage scenarios.[60]

List of iPhone models

The iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini (stylized as iPhone 13 mini) are smartphones developed and marketed by Apple. They are the fifteenth generation of iPhones, succeeding the iPhone 12 and 12 Mini. They were unveiled at an Apple Event in Apple Park in Cupertino, California, on September 14, 2021, alongside the higher-priced iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max flagships. They were released on September 24, 2021.[12][13]

The iPhone 13 Mini was discontinued in September 2023, and the iPhone 13 was discontinued in September 2024 with the announcement of the iPhone 16.


History
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini were officially announced alongside the ninth-generation iPad, 6th generation iPad Mini, Apple Watch Series 7, iPhone 13 Pro, and iPhone 13 Pro Max by a virtual press event filmed and recorded at Apple Park in Cupertino, California, on September 14, 2021. Pre-orders began on September 17, 2021, at 5:00 am PDT. Pricing starts at US$799 for the iPhone 13 and US$699 for the iPhone 13 Mini.[14]

Together with iPhone 12, the iPhone 13 Mini was discontinued on September 12, 2023, with the announcement of the iPhone 15 and 15 Pro. The iPhone 13 continues to be sold until the announcement of the iPhone 16 and 16 Pro on September 9, 2024, when it was discontinued alongside the iPhone 15 Pro.


Design
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 13 has a flat chassis analogous to that of contemporaneous Apple products with some differences such as the rear cameras being larger and arranged diagonally. The Face ID True Depth sensor housing on the iPhone is 20% smaller yet taller than its predecessors.[15]

The iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini are available in six colors: Midnight, Starlight, Product Red, Blue, Pink, and Green.[16][17]

On March 8, 2022, at Apple's Special Event "Peek Performance", Apple revealed a new Green color option, which became available and released on March 18, 2022. [16][17]


Specifications
--------------------------------------------------

Hardware
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini use an Apple-designed A15 Bionic system on a chip. The iPhone 13 and 13 Mini feature a 6-core CPU, 4-core GPU, and 16-core Neural Engine, while the iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max feature a 5-core GPU.[18]


Display
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 13 features a 6.1-inch (155 mm) display with Super Retina XDR OLED technology at a resolution of 2532×1170 pixels and a pixel density of about 460 PPI with a refresh rate of 60 Hz. The iPhone 13 Mini features a 5.4-inch (137 mm) display with the same technology at a resolution of 2340×1080 pixels and a pixel density of about 476 PPI. Both models have the Super Retina XDR OLED display with improved typical brightness up to 800 nits, and max brightness up to 1200 nits.[19]


Cameras
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 13 and 13 Mini feature the same camera system with three cameras: one front-facing camera (12MP f/2.2) and two back-facing cameras: a wide (12MP f/1.6) and ultra-wide (12MP f/2.4) camera. The back-facing cameras both contain larger sensors for more light-gathering with new sensor shift optical image stabilization (OIS) on the main camera. The camera module on the back is arranged diagonally instead of vertically to engineer the larger sensors.[3]

The cameras use Apple's latest computational photography engine, called Smart HDR 4. Users can also choose from a range of photographic styles during capture, including rich contrast, vibrant, warm, and cool. Apple clarifies this is different from a filter because it works intelligently with the image processing algorithm during capture to apply local adjustments to an image and the effects will be baked into the photos, unlike filters which can be removed after applying.[3]

The camera app contains a new mode called Cinematic Mode, which allows users to rack focus between subjects and create (simulate) shallow depth of field using software algorithms. It is supported on wide and front-facing cameras in 1080p at 30 fps.[3]


Charging
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 13 and 13 Mini have Lightning fast charging at 20 Watts, and wireless charging via MagSafe at 15 W (iPhone 13) or 12 W (13 Mini), or via the Qi protocol at 7.5 W.


Software
--------------------------------------------------
iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini were originally shipped with iOS 15 at launch.[20] They are compatible with iOS 16, which was released on September 12, 2022. The latest software iOS 17, which was revealed at Apple's WWDC 2023 event, is compatible with the iPhone 13 and 13 Mini.[21] The next-generation Qi2 wireless charging standard has been added to the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini with the update to iOS 17.2.[22] It is compatible with iOS 18, which was released on September 16, 2024.[23]

The 13 and 13 Mini are able to make calls via: FaceTime Audio / Video (not available in some regions); Voice over LTE (VoLTE); Wi-Fi Calling (not available in some regions models). Wi-Fi hotspotting is also possible


Repairability
--------------------------------------------------
Some iPhone 13 parts are paired to the motherboard. The user is warned if a paired component (e.g. screen, battery) is replaced by independent repair shops, and the Face ID sensors may completely cease to function if replaced. On later iOS versions Apple removed this limitation. Apple technicians have a proprietary software tool to pair components.[24][25]

List of iPhone models

The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus are smartphones developed and marketed by Apple Inc. They are the sixteenth-generation iPhones, succeeding the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini, and were announced during Apple Event, Apple Park in Cupertino, California, on September 7, 2022, alongside the higher-priced iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max flagships. The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus feature a 6.1-inch (15 cm) and 6.7-inch (17 cm) display, improvements to the rear-facing camera, and satellite connectivity for contacting emergency services when a user in trouble is beyond the range of Wi-Fi or cellular networks.[11][12] The iPhone 14 was made available on September 16, 2022,[13] and iPhone 14 Plus was made available on October 7, 2022, priced at $799 and $899 respectively and was launched with iOS 16.[8][14] Pre-orders for the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus began on September 9, 2022.[15] Along with the 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max, the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus are the last iPhones to feature the Lightning port, as their successors, the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus (announced on September 12, 2023), use a USB-C port instead, per European Commission regulation.[16][17]

The iPhone 14 does not have a "Mini" version like its predecessor, the iPhone 13. Instead, Apple returned to a larger model with the iPhone 14 Plus. Apple had not introduced a "Plus" model iPhone since the iPhone 8 Plus in 2017. Both iPhone 14 models (as well as iPhone 14 Pro models) sold in the United States, ended support for physical SIM cards, making them the first iPhone models since the CDMA variant of the iPhone 4 to not come with a discrete SIM card reader, requiring activation by way of eSIM.[18] With Apple retiring the iPhone 13 in September 2024, the iPhone 14 is currently the oldest iPhone model still fully supported and sold by Apple.


History
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 14 was originally rumored to come with 6.1-inch and 5.4-inch display size options. However, when the iPhone 14 was unveiled, no smaller display option was available. This may have been due to underwhelming sales of the iPhone 12 Mini and iPhone 13 Mini. Instead, a larger 6.7-inch display size option was added to the lower-priced iPhone 14 lineup.[19][20] The new 6.7-inch variant of the iPhone 14 was named "iPhone 14 Plus", rather than "iPhone 14 Max", which was predicted by previous rumors.[21][22]

The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus were officially announced at Apple's "Far Out" event, along with the iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 14 Pro Max, Apple Watch Series 8, Apple Watch SE (2nd generation), Apple Watch Ultra, AirPods Pro (2nd generation) and an update to Apple Fitness+ via a virtual press conference filmed at Apple Park in Cupertino, California on September 7, 2022.[23][24]

Apple started taking pre-orders on September 9, with general availability from September 16 for the iPhone 14 and October 7 for the iPhone 14 Plus.[25]


Design
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus have an identical design to the iPhone 13, although the US models do not have a physical SIM tray.

The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus are available in six colors: Blue, Purple, Midnight, Starlight, Yellow, and Product Red.[27] Purple is a new color replacing Pink used on the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini. The yellow colour option was added on March 7, 2023.[28]


Hardware
--------------------------------------------------
iPhone 14 and 14 Plus are available in three internal storage configurations: 128, 256, and 512 GB. Both models have 6 GB of RAM, an increase over the previous iPhone 13 and 13 mini models' 4 GB of RAM. The iPhone 14 and 14 Plus have the same IP68 rating for dust and water resistance as their predecessors.[7]


Chipset
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 14 and 14 Plus use a 5-nanometer Apple-designed SOC, the A15 Bionic, while the iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max have a newer A16 Bionic.[29][30]

The iPhone 14's A15 chip has a 6-core CPU, 5-core GPU, and a 16-core Neural Engine. It is identical to the A15 in the previous year's iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max,[29][30] which has more memory and an additional GPU core compared to the A15 in the non-Pro iPhone 13 models.[31][32]

The iPhone 14 was the first flagship model since the 2008 iPhone 3G, whose chip was unchanged from the previous year.[29] The Verge's Mitchell Clark attributed the unchanged chip to an attempt to maintain costs during the ongoing chip shortage and inflation surge. Clark also said the A15 "still outperforms the latest chips from Qualcomm and Google in most benchmarks", though the older chip may lead to the iPhone 14 receiving fewer updates, similar to what happened with the iPhone 5C from 2013.[29][30]


Display
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 14 features a 6.1-inch (155 mm) display with Super Retina XDR OLED technology at a resolution of 2532 × 1170 pixels and a pixel density of about 460 PPI with a refresh rate of 60 Hz. The iPhone 14 Plus features a 6.7-inch (170 mm) display with the same technology at a resolution of 2778 × 1284 pixels and a pixel density of around 458 PPI. Both models have typical brightness of up to 800 nits, and a max brightness of up to 1200 nits.[7]


Cameras
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 14 and 14 Plus feature the same camera system with two cameras: one front-facing camera (12MP f/1.9), and two back-facing cameras: a wide (12MP f/1.5) and ultra-wide (12MP f/2.4) camera, with the wide and front-facing cameras having a faster aperture than the iPhone 13. The front-facing camera also has autofocus for the first time.[33]

The cameras use Apple's latest computational photography engine, called Smart HDR 4. Users can also choose from a range of photographic styles during capture, including rich contrast, vibrant, warm, and cool. Apple clarifies this is different from a filter because it works intelligently with the image processing algorithm during capture to apply local adjustments to an image, and the effects will be baked into the photos, unlike filters which can be removed after applying.[7]

The camera app contains Cinematic Mode, which allows users to rack focus between subjects and create (simulate) shallow depth of field using software algorithms. It is supported on wide and front-facing cameras in 4K at 30 fps and 60 fps.[7]

An "Action mode" feature was added to extend the electrical video stabilization. When activated, a smaller crop of the image sensor is read out for video recording. While reducing the field of view, a wider area around it can be used as buffer against shakes. The area read out from the image sensor is moved between frames to counteract hand movements.[34]


Battery
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 14 is equipped with slightly longer battery life compared to the iPhone 13. According to Apple, the iPhone 14 (3,279 mAh) can provide up to 20 hours of video playback,[35] 16 hours of streaming video playback, and 80 hours of audio playback. Its predecessor, the iPhone 13 (3,240 mAh), is rated for up to 19 hours of video playback, 15 hours of streaming video playback, and 75 hours of audio playback. The larger iPhone 14 Plus (4,325 mAh) variant provides up to 26 hours of video playback.[36]


Software
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 14 and 14 Plus originally shipped with iOS 16. The next-generation Qi2 wireless charging standard was added to the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus with the update to iOS 17.2.[37] The latest version of iOS, iOS 18, which was revealed at Apple's WWDC 2024 event, was released to the public on September 16, 2024, and is compatible with the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus.

Satellite connectivity
--------------------------------------------------
Apple's new Emergency SOS via satellite service for iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro models uses the spectrum in L and S bands designated for mobile satellite services by ITU Radio Regulations. When an iPhone user makes an Emergency SOS via satellite request, the message is received by an orbiting satellite operated by Globalstar. The satellite then sends the message down to ground stations located across the globe.[11]

As of November 2022, Globalstar operates a constellation of 25 satellites in low Earth orbit, with plans to enhance this in the future via its partnership with Apple.[11][42]

The service became available to US and Canada on November 15, 2022, and to the UK, Germany, Ireland, and France on December 13, 2022.[43] From May 15, 2023 the service became available in Australia and New Zealand.[44]


Criticism
--------------------------------------------------

Crash Detection false positives
--------------------------------------------------
Crash Detection is a feature built into the iPhone 14 that is designed to detect severe car crashes and automatically initiates an emergency phone call 20 seconds after it is detected unless the user cancels it.[45] Since its release, there have been many reports saying that the feature was automatically turned on during rollercoaster rides, due to the fact that the rides suddenly stop after going at high speeds, acting the same way a car crash does.[46][47]

Emergency dispatchers have received many false alarm calls from iPhone 14 and Apple Watch users who have been skiing safely. In Colorado, a wave of false 9-1-1 calls led Aspen Mountain to advise device owners to upgrade their operating systems or disable the feature.[48] In Japan's Hida Mountains, emergency dispatchers reported 134 false emergency calls, more than 14% of the total emergency call volume, between December 16, 2022, and January 23, 2023, attributed to Crash Detection triggering while an iPhone 14 owner was skiing.[49]


Repairability
--------------------------------------------------
While the iPhone 14 was originally lauded for its innovative new hardware design and recommended by iFixit, concerns over software limitations on parts not authorized by Apple caused iFixit to decrease their evaluation to a 4/10 or "not recommended" in September 2023.[50][51]

List of iPhone models

The iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini (stylized as iPhone 13 mini) are smartphones developed and marketed by Apple. They are the fifteenth generation of iPhones, succeeding the iPhone 12 and 12 Mini. They were unveiled at an Apple Event in Apple Park in Cupertino, California, on September 14, 2021, alongside the higher-priced iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max flagships. They were released on September 24, 2021.[12][13]

The iPhone 13 Mini was discontinued in September 2023, and the iPhone 13 was discontinued in September 2024 with the announcement of the iPhone 16.


History
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini were officially announced alongside the ninth-generation iPad, 6th generation iPad Mini, Apple Watch Series 7, iPhone 13 Pro, and iPhone 13 Pro Max by a virtual press event filmed and recorded at Apple Park in Cupertino, California, on September 14, 2021. Pre-orders began on September 17, 2021, at 5:00 am PDT. Pricing starts at US$799 for the iPhone 13 and US$699 for the iPhone 13 Mini.[14]

Together with iPhone 12, the iPhone 13 Mini was discontinued on September 12, 2023, with the announcement of the iPhone 15 and 15 Pro. The iPhone 13 continues to be sold until the announcement of the iPhone 16 and 16 Pro on September 9, 2024, when it was discontinued alongside the iPhone 15 Pro.


Design
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 13 has a flat chassis analogous to that of contemporaneous Apple products with some differences such as the rear cameras being larger and arranged diagonally. The Face ID True Depth sensor housing on the iPhone is 20% smaller yet taller than its predecessors.[15]

The iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini are available in six colors: Midnight, Starlight, Product Red, Blue, Pink, and Green.[16][17]

On March 8, 2022, at Apple's Special Event "Peek Performance", Apple revealed a new Green color option, which became available and released on March 18, 2022. [16][17]


Specifications
--------------------------------------------------

Hardware
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini use an Apple-designed A15 Bionic system on a chip. The iPhone 13 and 13 Mini feature a 6-core CPU, 4-core GPU, and 16-core Neural Engine, while the iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max feature a 5-core GPU.[18]


Display
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 13 features a 6.1-inch (155 mm) display with Super Retina XDR OLED technology at a resolution of 2532×1170 pixels and a pixel density of about 460 PPI with a refresh rate of 60 Hz. The iPhone 13 Mini features a 5.4-inch (137 mm) display with the same technology at a resolution of 2340×1080 pixels and a pixel density of about 476 PPI. Both models have the Super Retina XDR OLED display with improved typical brightness up to 800 nits, and max brightness up to 1200 nits.[19]


Cameras
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 13 and 13 Mini feature the same camera system with three cameras: one front-facing camera (12MP f/2.2) and two back-facing cameras: a wide (12MP f/1.6) and ultra-wide (12MP f/2.4) camera. The back-facing cameras both contain larger sensors for more light-gathering with new sensor shift optical image stabilization (OIS) on the main camera. The camera module on the back is arranged diagonally instead of vertically to engineer the larger sensors.[3]

The cameras use Apple's latest computational photography engine, called Smart HDR 4. Users can also choose from a range of photographic styles during capture, including rich contrast, vibrant, warm, and cool. Apple clarifies this is different from a filter because it works intelligently with the image processing algorithm during capture to apply local adjustments to an image and the effects will be baked into the photos, unlike filters which can be removed after applying.[3]

The camera app contains a new mode called Cinematic Mode, which allows users to rack focus between subjects and create (simulate) shallow depth of field using software algorithms. It is supported on wide and front-facing cameras in 1080p at 30 fps.[3]


Charging
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 13 and 13 Mini have Lightning fast charging at 20 Watts, and wireless charging via MagSafe at 15 W (iPhone 13) or 12 W (13 Mini), or via the Qi protocol at 7.5 W.


Software
--------------------------------------------------
iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini were originally shipped with iOS 15 at launch.[20] They are compatible with iOS 16, which was released on September 12, 2022. The latest software iOS 17, which was revealed at Apple's WWDC 2023 event, is compatible with the iPhone 13 and 13 Mini.[21] The next-generation Qi2 wireless charging standard has been added to the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini with the update to iOS 17.2.[22] It is compatible with iOS 18, which was released on September 16, 2024.[23]

The 13 and 13 Mini are able to make calls via: FaceTime Audio / Video (not available in some regions); Voice over LTE (VoLTE); Wi-Fi Calling (not available in some regions models). Wi-Fi hotspotting is also possible


Repairability
--------------------------------------------------
Some iPhone 13 parts are paired to the motherboard. The user is warned if a paired component (e.g. screen, battery) is replaced by independent repair shops, and the Face ID sensors may completely cease to function if replaced. On later iOS versions Apple removed this limitation. Apple technicians have a proprietary software tool to pair components.[24][25]

List of iPhone models

The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are smartphones developed and marketed by Apple. They are the seventeenth generation of iPhones, succeeding the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus. The devices were announced on September 12, 2023, during the Apple Event at Apple Park in Cupertino, California alongside the higher-priced iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max. Pre-orders began on September 15, 2023, and the devices were made available on September 22, 2023. Like the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, the 15 and 15 Plus are the first iPhones to replace the proprietary Lightning connector with USB-C to comply with European Union mandates.


History
--------------------------------------------------
In September 2021, the European Commission began considering a proposal to mandate USB-C on all devices in the European Union, including iPhones.[10] Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo claimed that Apple would drop its proprietary Lightning connector by 2023. At the time of those claims, Apple was considering switching to USB-C due to the likelihood that the EU proposal would pass.[11] The proposal was passed into law in October 2022, becoming the Radio Equipment Directive. Apple confirmed it would comply with the regulations later that month.[12]

Two weeks prior to the formal introduction of the iPhone 15, it was announced that some of the devices which were made in India would for the first time be sold around the world on the launch day.[13]


Design
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 15 is the first major redesign since the iPhone 12, featuring rounder edges and a slightly curved display, and back glass. Both models are available in five colors: blue, pink, yellow, green and black.[1] This makes it the first entry level iPhone since the iPhone XR to not ship with a Product Red variant at launch.


Hardware
--------------------------------------------------

Display
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 15 features a 6.1-inch (155 mm) display with Super Retina XDR OLED technology at a resolution of 2556×1179 pixels and a pixel density of about 460 PPI with a refresh rate of 60 Hz. The iPhone 15 Plus features a 6.7-inch (170 mm) display with the same technology at a resolution of 2796×1290 pixels and a pixel density of about 460 PPI. Both models have an improved typical brightness of up to 1,000 nits, a peak HDR brightness of up to 1,600 nits, and a peak outdoor brightness of up to 2,000 nits.[9] The Dynamic Island feature, previously exclusive to iPhone 14 Pro, is now standard on iPhone 15, replacing the notch that was introduced in the iPhone X.[14]


Charging and transfer speeds
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus use USB-C with USB 2.0 transfer speeds (up to 480 Mb/s or 60 MB/s),[15] compared to the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max which have faster USB 3.2 Gen 2 transfer speeds (up to 10 Gb/s or 1.25 GB/s).[16] The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus, as well as the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, are the first iPhone models to use USB-C, as well as the first iPhones since the iPhone 5 to switch to a new charging port.


Video output
--------------------------------------------------
All iPhone 15 models have support for DisplayPort Alternate Mode over USB-C video output with HDR up to 4K resolution.[9]

Previous iPhone models (from iPhone 5 until iPhone 14) had a maximum supported resolution of 1600 x 900 (slightly less than 1080p) with the Lightning Digital AV Adapter due to technical constraints of the Lightning connector.[17]


Battery
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 15 Plus offers users up to 26 hours of video playback and up to 100 hours of audio playback, and the iPhone 15 offers significantly less, with up to 20 hours of video playback and up to 80 hours of audio playback.[18]


Software
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus launched with iOS 17 and is compatible with iOS 18.[19][20][21] Consistent with the UK Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure regulation, it will continue to receive major software updates for a minimum of five years to at least 2028.[22]


Specifications
--------------------------------------------------
6.33 by 3.06 in (161 by 78 mm)

5.81 by 2.82 in (148 by 72 mm)

Criticism
--------------------------------------------------

Overheating
--------------------------------------------------
Some owners claimed that their iPhone 15s were experiencing overheating issues,[26] reportedly reaching temperatures as high as 47 °C (117 °F).[27] Apple later stated that there were several reasons why the phones heat up, mainly hinting at a software issue.[28] It was stated that it would be fixed with an update to iOS 17.0.3.[29] The overheating issues were reported to persist after the update.[30]

List of iPhone models

The iPhone 4 is a smartphone that was developed and marketed by Apple Inc. It is the fourth generation of the iPhone lineup, succeeding the iPhone 3GS and preceding the iPhone 4s. Following a number of notable leaks, the iPhone 4 was first unveiled on June 7, 2010, at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco,[7] and was released on June 24, 2010, in the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Japan.

The iPhone 4 introduced a new hardware design to the iPhone family, which Apple's CEO Steve Jobs touted as the thinnest smartphone in the world at the time; it consisted of a stainless steel frame which doubled as an antenna, with internal components situated between two panels of aluminosilicate glass.[8] The iPhone 4 introduced Apple's new high-resolution "Retina display" (with a pixel density of 326 pixels per inch), while maintaining the same physical size and aspect ratio as its precursors, Apple's A4 system-on-chip, along with iOS 4—which notably introduced multitasking functionality and app folders. It was the first iPhone at the time to include a front-facing camera, which made possible Apple's new FaceTime video chat service, and the first to be released in a version for CDMA networks, ending AT&T's period as the exclusive carrier of iPhone products in the United States.

The iPhone 4 received a largely positive reception, with critics praising its revamped design and more powerful hardware, in comparison to previous models. While it was a market success (with over 600,000 pre-orders within 24 hours), the release of the iPhone 4 was plagued by highly publicized reports concerning abnormalities in its new antenna design that caused the device to lose its cellular signal if held in a certain way. Most direct contact with the phone's outer edge would cause a significant decrease in signal strength. Apple released iOS 4.0.1 to try to fix these issues, but were unsuccessful.[9]

The iPhone 4 spent the longest time as Apple's flagship iPhone model at fifteen months. Although the succeeding 4S was announced in October 2011, the 4 continued to be sold as a midrange model until September 2012, and thereafter as the entry-level offering in Apple's lineup until September 2013 with the announcement of the iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c. The iPhone 4 had one of the longest lifespans of any iPhone ever produced, spanning close to four years and available in some developing countries until early 2015.


History
--------------------------------------------------

Prototypes
--------------------------------------------------
Before the official unveiling of the iPhone 4 on June 7, 2010, two prototypes were brought to the attention of the media, breaching Apple's normally secretive development process. Many of the speculations regarding technical specifications proved accurate.


Engadget leak
--------------------------------------------------
On January 27, 2010, gadget website Engadget received leaked images of the unreleased first-generation iPad.[10] Unbeknownst to the editors and readers, these images contained two unreleased iPhone 4 models.[11] It wasn't until the subsequent Gizmodo release that they were aware of the complete contents of the images.[12]


Gizmodo leak
--------------------------------------------------
On April 19, 2010, gadget website Gizmodo reported that they had purchased an iPhone prototype for $5000, and furthermore, had conducted a product teardown of the device. The prototype was reported to have been lost by an Apple employee, Gray Powell, in Redwood City, California.[13] Shortly after Gizmodo published detailed information about the prototype, Apple's legal associates formally requested for the phone to be returned to Apple, and Gizmodo responded with the intent to cooperate.[14]

On April 23, officers from the Rapid Enforcement Allied Computer Team (REACT) task force of the California HTTAP Program raided the home of Jason Chen, the Gizmodo editor responsible for reviewing the prototype, seizing all of his computers and hard drives.[15] The Electronic Frontier Foundation criticized the raid as violating journalist source protection laws that forbid the seizure of journalist computers, as well as the suspicion that Apple had used its influence as a member of the steering committee, which is charged with direction and oversight of the California REACT task force to push police into action in a way that would not normally be conducted for this type of incident. Apple had already received the iPhone prototype before the raid when it was returned by Gizmodo.[16] The District Attorney stated that the investigation was suspended, and discontinued searching through the Gizmodo editor's belongings as they determine whether the shield laws are applicable, and cautioned that no charges have been issued at this point.[17][18]


Taoviet leak
--------------------------------------------------
Pictures and video of a second prototype were published on a Vietnamese website, Taoviet, on May 12, 2010.[19] It was almost identical to the first, and used an A4 chip manufactured by Apple.[20] The website purchased the prototype for $4,000.[21] DigiTimes reported that the screen resolution of the new phone was 960-by-640, which was confirmed by Apple at the iPhone 4's official announcement.


Release
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 4 was available for pre-order on June 15, 2010.[22] Customers attempting to pre-order the iPhone 4 reported problems with the pre-order process on the US and UK online Apple Stores which crashed due to the surge in traffic.[23] The same issue was reported with AT&T and SoftBank, Apple's exclusive partners in the United States and Japan respectively, who suspended advance sales of the iPhone 4 as demand threatened to exceed supply.[24] Retail stores were also unable to complete pre-order transactions due to the servers crashing.[25]

Apple and its partner carriers received 600,000 pre-orders for the iPhone 4 in the first 24 hours, the largest number of pre-orders Apple had received in a single day for any device up to that point.[26] Engadget reported that at 20:30 UTC, all iPhone 4 pre-order suppliers had sold out.[27] 1.7 million iPhone 4 models were sold in its first three days of availability.[28]

The iPhone 4 was also released through Orange in Tunisia and was available in eight cities at the launch.[29] On July 30, 2010, iPhone 4 was made available for sale in Australia, New Zealand and 15 other countries with free bumper cases.[30][31] In South Korea, it was released by KT on September 10. In Israel, it was released, too, on September 24, through Cellcom, Pelephone and Orange. It was launched in Thailand on September 23 by AIS, DTAC and True Move, and in Malaysia on September 26 in Kuala Lumpur, and nationwide on September 27 according to the Malaysian service provider Maxis.

The iPhone 4 was released in South Africa on September 22 on the Vodacom and MTN networks, in very limited quantities.[32] The iPhone 4 was launched in Vietnam on September 30 on VinaPhone and Viettel, at first in three major cities: Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City and Da Nang, and then all over the country by the end of October.

The iPhone 4 was launched in India on May 27, 2011 by Aircel and Airtel.[33]

On January 11, 2011, Verizon Wireless announced during a media event that it had reached an agreement with Apple and would begin selling a CDMA iPhone 4 in the United States, ending Apple's exclusivity agreement with AT&T. The Verizon iPhone went on sale on February 10 and pre orders began on February 3.[34][35][36] The Verizon iPhone includes the 'Personal Hotspot" feature which allows a user to use the iPhone as a wireless hotspot, with up to five devices connecting at one time. The February 3, 2011, presale of the iPhone 4 broke Verizon's first day sales records for a single device.[37]

On June 24, 2010, Apple stated that the white iPhone 4 models were proving more "challenging to manufacture" than expected, and initially pushed the release date back to the second half of July.[38] There was a lot of speculation surrounding the delay of the white iPhone 4. Among the most popular rumours are those concerning the phone's internal camera being adversely affected by light leaking in due to the semi-translucent glass and the white paint.[39][40] Other sources report that the problem relates to Apple's inability to match the white colour of the front faceplate with that of the home button.[41] On April 27, 2011, Apple announced that it would be releasing the white iPhone 4 model on April 28, 2011, for both GSM and CDMA.[42] The release of the white iPhone 4 was carried out on April 28.[43][44]

During Apple's official unveiling of the iPhone 4s on October 4, 2011, it was announced that Sprint would begin carrying the CDMA iPhone 4 and the iPhone 4s in the US on October 14.[45][46]


Discontinuation
--------------------------------------------------
In September 2013, after the release of the iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c, Apple stopped selling the iPhone 4 in most of their stores as well as on their website. It was replaced by the 8 GB iPhone 4s.[47][48][49]


Hardware
--------------------------------------------------

Display
--------------------------------------------------
The display of the iPhone 4 was manufactured by LG under an exclusive contract with Apple. It features an LED backlit TFT LCD capacitive touchscreen with a pixel density of 326 pixels per inch (ppi) on a 3.5 in (8.9 cm) (diagonally measured), 960×640 display. Each pixel is 78 micrometers in width. The display has a contrast ratio of 800:1. The screen was marketed by Apple as the "Retina display", based on the assertion that a display of approximately 300 ppi at a distance of 305 millimetres (12 in) from one's eye, or 57 arcseconds per pixel,[50] is the maximum amount of detail that the human retina can perceive.[51] With the iPhone expected to be used at a distance of about 12 inches from the eyes, a higher resolution would allegedly have no effect on the image's apparent quality as the maximum potential of the human eye has already been met.

This claim was widely disputed. Raymond Soneira, president of DisplayMate Technologies, said in an interview with the Wired magazine, that his claims by Jobs are something of an exaggeration: "It is reasonably close to being a perfect display, but Steve pushed it a little too far". Soneira stated that the resolution of the human retina is higher than claimed by Apple, working out to 477 PPI at 12 inches (305 mm) from the eyes, or 36 arcseconds per pixel.[52]

However, Phil Plait, author of Bad Astronomy, whose career includes a collaboration with NASA regarding the camera on the Hubble Space Telescope, responded to the criticism by stating that "if you have [better than 20/20] eyesight, then at one foot away the iPhone 4's pixels are resolved. The picture will look pixellated. If you have average eyesight, the picture will look just fine".[53][54]


Camera
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 4 features an additional front-facing 640x480 camera, and a backside-illuminated 5 megapixel rear-facing camera with a 3.85 mm f/2.8 lens[55][1] and an LED flash. The rear-facing 5-megapixel camera is capable of recording HD video in 720p at 30 frames per second. Both cameras make use of the tap to focus feature, part of iOS 4, for photo and video recording.[56] The rear-facing camera has a 5× digital zoom.


Connectivity
--------------------------------------------------
In contrast to Steve Jobs' announcement at WWDC 2010, Federal Communications Commission documentation showed that, in fact, the iPhone 4 contains a penta-band 3G UMTS antenna, not a quad-band 3G UMTS radio, as advertised by Apple [citation needed]. According to the FCC documentation filed by Apple, the radio inside the iPhone 4 supports 800, 850, 900, 1,900, and 2,100 MHz. The 800 MHz frequency, which is most commonly used in Japanese mobile phones, is not advertised as being supported by Apple.[57] However, the 800 MHz band is a subset of the 850 MHz band, which probably explains why the device was advertised as quad-band.[citation needed] The chip-sets were manufactured by Skyworks Solutions[58] and Infineon for GSM version.

As with most of Apple's mobile products at the time, the iPhone 4 also used the 30 pin dock connector as its only external data port.

The iPhone 4 is the first generation of iPhone to have a second microphone used for noise cancellation. It is located on the top of the unit near the headphone jack; the main microphone is on the bottom left.[59]


Gyroscope and accelerometer
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 4 introduces a gyroscopic sensor that detects 3-axis angular acceleration around the X, Y, and Z axes, enabling precise calculation of yaw, pitch, and roll. The gyroscope complements the accelerometer, a sensor that has been present since the original iPhone, which detects the device's acceleration, shake, vibration shock, or fall by detecting linear acceleration along with one of three axes (X, Y, and Z). The combined data from the accelerometer and the gyroscope provides detailed and precise information about the device's 6-axis movement in space. The 3 axes of the gyroscope combined with the 3 axes of the accelerometer enable the device to recognize approximately how far, fast, and in which direction it has moved in space.[60]


Processor, memory and storage
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 4 is powered by the Apple A4 chip, which was designed by Intrinsity[61] and, like all prior iPhone models, manufactured by Samsung.[62] This system-on-a-chip is composed of an ARM Cortex-A8 CPU integrated with a PowerVR SGX535 GPU.[63] The Apple A4 was also used in the first-generation iPad (released in 2010), where it was clocked at its rated speed of 1 GHz. The Apple A4 was the first ever mobile phone processor designed by Apple. The clock speed in the iPhone 4 was never disclosed. All prior models of the iPhone had underclocked the CPU, which typically extends battery life and lowers heat dissipation.

The iPhone 4 has 512 MB of DRAM. The additional DRAM supports increased performance and multi-tasking.[64] As on prior models, all data is stored in flash memory, 8, 16 or 32 GB, and not on the SIM. Unlike prior generations, the storage capacity is not printed on the back of the unit.


Micro-SIM
--------------------------------------------------
The GSM iPhone 4 uses a micro-SIM card, which is positioned in an ejectable tray, located on the right side of the device. The CDMA iPhone 4, however, the phone connects to the network using an ESN. All prior models have used regular mini-SIM cards. Depending on the operator, micro-SIM cards may not be available for all networks globally. As a technical workaround, it is possible to trim a mini-SIM card with a knife or scissors so that it fits into the micro-SIM tray.[65]


Design
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 4 features a redesigned structure, designed by Jony Ive, a design that would later be reused and adapted for the iPhone 4S, 5, 5S and first-generation iPhone SE. Most notably, the bulges of the back panel as well as the band between the front and back are gone and have been replaced with flattened surfaces. The redesign reflects the utilitarianism and uniformity of existing Apple products, such as the iPad and the iMac. The overall dimensions of the iPhone 4 have been reduced from their predecessor.[66]

It is 115 millimetres (4.5 in) high, 58.6 millimetres (2.31 in) wide, and 9.4 millimetres (0.37 in) deep, compared to the iPhone 3GS, which is 116 millimetres (4.6 in) high, 62 millimetres (2.4 in) wide, and 12 millimetres (0.47 in) deep; making the iPhone 4 24% thinner than its predecessor, the iPhone 3GS. Steve Jobs claimed it to be "the thinnest smartphone on the planet."[66] The reduced size of the device is primarily due to the externally placed antenna.

The iPhone 4 is structured around a stainless steel frame that wraps around the edge of the phone, acting both as the primary structure for the device and as the iPhone 4's antennas. This metal band features two slits on the GSM version of the phone, one at the lower left, and one at the top (and a fake slit along the lower right, to cosmetically mirror the one at the lower left) that divide the band into two antenna sections: the left section of the band serves as the Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and GPS antenna, and the right and lower sections of the band act as the antenna for GSM and UMTS connectivity.

On the CDMA version of the phone, there are four slits in the metal band. Two at the top (on the left and right) and two at the bottom. This divides the metal band into four different segments, which like the GSM version of the phone, serve as different antennas for connectivity. The top portion of the band (divided by the top left and right slits) is for connecting to the CDMA network. The left portion of the metal band is for Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and GPS just like the GSM version. The right side is not an antenna but serves to cosmetically mirror the left side and also to create a similar look to the GSM version of the phone.

The internal components are situated between two panels of aluminosilicate glass, described by Apple as being "chemically strengthened to be 20 times stiffer and 30 times harder than plastic," theoretically allowing it to be more scratch-resistant and durable than the prior models.[8]

In fall 2010, pentalobe screws started to replace the Philips screws used in post-repair units in the US and in production units in Japan.[67]


Software
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 4 shipped with iOS 4, which was the newest version of Apple's iOS mobile operating system at the time. iOS 4 introduced a multitasking system, allowing apps to remain "suspended" in memory, perform certain operations in the background, and allowing users to switch between apps using an on-screen menu.[68] It also introduced FaceTime, which allows users to perform video calls between other iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, and Mac OS X users.

The iPhone 4 supports up to iOS 7, released in September 2013. Due to the relatively aged hardware of the iPhone 4, most features available on newer iPhone models are not available on the device; as of iOS 7, they include Siri, 3D maps and turn-by-turn navigation, AirDrop, AirPlay mirroring, live camera filters, panorama mode and certain visual effects introduced by iOS 7, such as the blurring of translucent interface elements, the parallax effect on the home screen, and live wallpapers.[69] While still subject to the same limitations, iOS 7.1 did bring some slight performance improvements to the operating system on the iPhone 4. iOS 7, specifically iOS 7.1.2, is the last version of iOS to support the iPhone 4. Unlike the iPhone 4s, the iPhone 4 did not receive the iOS 8 update due to performance issues.[70][71]


Accessories
--------------------------------------------------

Bumper
--------------------------------------------------
Apple released a plastic and rubber case called the Bumper to protect the edges of the phone. The case, which also provided some screen protection, included buttons and holes that enabled switch and connector access.[72]

Apple updated the bumper with a wider volume switch hole with the release of the iPhone 4 for CDMA networks. The updated bumper is also compatible with iPhone 4s, the next-generation iPhone that has the same exterior design and measurements as the CDMA model of the iPhone 4, but with a SIM card slot as well.


Reception
--------------------------------------------------

Pre-release
--------------------------------------------------
Pre-release reception was largely positive.[73] The announcement included information that had not been covered by Gizmodo. Fox News commented that "seeing it in action is far more informative than staring at Gizmodo's photos of a busted test unit".[74] Rhodri Marsden of The Independent said that "aside from the introduction of face-to-face video calling, it's not a staggering feature set," instead focusing on how the device is "more powerful than its predecessor, speedier, easier to use and will make previously laborious tasks seem like a cinch".[75]

CNET reacted to the announcement by explaining how it believes that iMovie for iOS was the "most exciting part of this year's WWDC Keynote". The article noted how the iPhone 4, unlike current cameras, can record HD content and then edit it from the same device, labeling it a "true mobile editing suite".[76]


Reviews
--------------------------------------------------
Reviews of the iPhone 4 were largely positive. Walt Mossberg of The Wall Street Journal called the device "the best device in its class".[77] Engadget named it the "best smartphone on the market" in June 2010.[78] CNET gave the iPhone 4 a rating of 8.6 out of 10, one of the highest ratings it had given any smartphone.[79] TechRadar gave the device 4.5/5 stars.[80] Consumer Reports said the signal problem was the reason they did not rate it a "recommended" model, although the other tests ranked it highest among smartphones.[81]

Joshua Topolsky of Engadget described the device's industrial design as being "more detailed and sophisticated" than its predecessor.[78]


Technical problems
--------------------------------------------------
Some users reported a yellow discoloration of the screen that disappeared after several days, which was attributed to the glass lamination glue that was used. It did not have time to dry fully before the unit reached consumers due to the speed of manufacturing.[82] Another issue reported by some users within days of the iPhone 4 release was that during calls the proximity sensor can be insensitive, so that facial contact with the touchscreen can end calls, mute calls, and dial other numbers.[83] Some users reported that, particularly in low-light conditions, photos taken on the iPhone 4 sometimes contained blue or green "splotches." Issues with white balance were also discovered, particularly when using the flash.[84][85]


Antenna
--------------------------------------------------
Shortly after the iPhone 4 was launched, some users reported that signal strength of the phone was reduced when touching the lower left edge of the phone, bridging one of the two locations which separates the two antennas, resulting in dropped calls in some areas with lower signal reception.[86][87][88] In response, Apple issued a statement advising that customers should "avoid gripping [the phone] in the lower left corner" when making or receiving a call.[89] Internally, senior antenna expert Ruben Caballero raised concerns to CEO Steve Jobs that the antenna design could lead to dropped calls.[90]

As a consequence of this problem, it was reported on July 2, 2010 that several iPhone 4 users were planning on suing Apple and AT&T for fraud by concealment, negligence, intentional misrepresentation and defective design. The legal challenge was started by a law firm, who set up a website to recruit disenchanted iPhone 4 buyers for a lawsuit against Apple.[91][92] Later that day, Apple issued another statement stating that it had discovered the cause of the "dramatic drop in bars".[93]

Apple explained how the formula it used to calculate the number of bars to display was "totally wrong". Apple promised to correct the issue and release a software update within a few weeks that would address the "mistake", which had been present since the original iPhone.[93] The New York Times commented that "the failure to detect this longstanding problem earlier is astonishing."[94]

Consumer Reports initially stated that the iPhone 4's signal issues are not "unique, and may not be serious" and it continued to mention that signal loss is a problem that is faced by the entire smartphone industry. It was such a problem that Apple made a formal apology onstage. The next day, the magazine altered their stance after encountering instances of dropped calls.[95] The magazine rejected Apple's explanation after conducting tests in a controlled environment, and comparing the results against prior generations of iPhone. It sarcastically pointed out that using a piece of tape to cover the lower left antenna gap was one way to fix the problem, but recommended that consumers who "want an iPhone that works well without a masking-tape fix" purchase the iPhone 3GS instead.[81] The magazine also tested the iPhone 4 while it was wearing a Bumper, a frame-like cover sold by Apple that prevents direct contact with the antenna, reporting that it did resolve the problem.[96] CNN repeated Consumer Reports' statement that a small amount of duct tape had proven an effective fix to the iPhone 4's dropped call issue.[97]

On July 16, 2010, at a press conference which included a private tour of Apple's antenna design lab for journalists,[98] Steve Jobs announced that Apple would provide all iPhone 4 owners with a free case to help solve the antenna issue and a refund to those users who had already purchased a Bumper. The free case offer would be valid until September 30, 2010, when Apple would re-evaluate the situation.[99][100] To get a free case, owners were able to apply via an app installed on the phone found in the App Store from July 22, 2010 to September 30, 2010. Jobs also announced that Apple could not produce enough Bumpers for all owners of the phone, but would source a supply and offer a range of cases.[101] Additionally, Jobs cited figures from AppleCare which showed that only 0.55 percent of all iPhone 4 users have complained to the company about the issue, while the number of phones returned to Apple was 1.7 percent – 4.3 percentage points less than the number of iPhone 3GS models that were returned in the first month of the phone's launch.[101]

Consumer Reports noted that the solution was not permanent, though a good first step.[102] However, because Jobs did not specify a time line for fixing the problem, and the offering for a free bumper only being a temporary solution, PC World decided to remove the iPhone 4 from its "Top 10 Cell Phones" chart and reassign it to a pending rating.[103]

Despite the negative media attention regarding the antenna issues, 72% of iPhone 4 users said that they were "very satisfied" with their iPhone 4 according to an August 2010 survey by ChangeWave Research.[104] The GSM iPhone 4 continued to be sold unchanged until its discontinuation in September 2013, while the CDMA iPhone 4 and all models of the iPhone 4S featured a tweaked antenna design to prevent the issue from happening.


iPhones in space
--------------------------------------------------
In 2011, two iPhone 4 units equipped with a special application were taken to the International Space Station aboard the Space Shuttle on the STS-135 mission.[105] The devices were used in various experiments, utilizing sensors and a special app.[105]

List of iPhone models

The iPhone 5 is a smartphone that was developed and marketed by Apple Inc. It is the 6th generation iPhone, succeeding the iPhone 4s, and preceding both the iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c. It was formally unveiled as part of a press event on September 12, 2012, and subsequently released on September 21, 2012. The iPhone 5 was the first iPhone to be announced in September, and setting a trend for subsequent iPhone releases, the first iPhone to be completely developed under the guidance of Tim Cook and the last iPhone to be overseen by Steve Jobs. The iPhone 5's design was used three times, first with the iPhone 5 itself in 2012, then with the iPhone 5s in 2013, and finally with the first-generation iPhone SE in 2016.

The iPhone 5 featured major design changes in comparison to its predecessor. These included an aluminum-based body which was thinner and lighter than previous models, a taller 4-inch screen with a nearly 16:9 aspect ratio, the Apple A6 system-on-chip, LTE support, and Lightning, a new compact dock connector which replaced the 30-pin design used by previous iPhone models. This was the second iPhone after the iPhone 4s to include Apple's new Sony-made 8 MP camera.

Apple began taking pre-orders on September 14, 2012, and over two million were received within 24 hours. Initial demand for the iPhone 5 exceeded the supply available at launch on September 21, 2012, and was described by Apple as "extraordinary", with pre-orders having sold twenty times faster than its predecessors. While reception to the iPhone 5 was generally positive, consumers and reviewers noted hardware issues, such as an unintended purple hue in photos taken, and the phone's coating being prone to chipping. Reception was also mixed over Apple's decision to switch to a different dock connector design, as the change affected iPhone 5's compatibility with accessories that were otherwise compatible with previous iterations of the line.

The iPhone 5 was officially discontinued by Apple on September 10, 2013, with the announcement of its successors, the iPhone 5s and the iPhone 5c. The iPhone 5 has the joint second-shortest lifespan of any iPhone ever produced with only twelve months in production, breaking with Apple's standard practice of selling an existing iPhone model at a reduced price upon the release of a new model. This was broken by the iPhone X which only had ten-months in production from November 2017 to September 2018, and tied with the iPhone XS which had twelve-months from September 2018 to September 2019.

It was replaced as a midrange and then an entry-level device by the iPhone 5c; the 5c internal hardware specifications are almost identical to the 5 albeit having a less expensive polycarbonate exterior shell. The iPhone 5 supports iOS 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10. The iPhone 5 does not support iOS 11 due to it dropping support for 32-bit devices. The iPhone 5 is the second iPhone to support five major versions of iOS after the iPhone 4s.


History
--------------------------------------------------
Rumors about the iPhone 5 began shortly after the announcement of the iPhone 4s, though detailed leaks did not emerge until June 2012.[12] On July 30, 2012, reports pinpointed the dates on which the iPhone 5 would be unveiled and released, along with some accurate predictions of its features.[13] On September 4, 2012, Apple announced they would be hosting an event at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco on September 12, 2012. A shadow of the numeral 5 was featured in the invitations sent to the media, suggesting that the next iPhone would be unveiled at the event.[14]

At the unveiling, Apple announced the iPhone 5 and also introduced new iPod Nano and iPod Touch models. They also stated that pre-orders would be accepted starting September 14, 2012.[1][15] Over two million pre-orders were received within 24 hours.[5][16] The iPhone 5 was made available for sale to the public on September 21, 2012.[17] Initial demand for the new phone exceeded the record set by its predecessor, the iPhone 4s, by selling over 5 million units in the first three days.[18] On November 30, 2012, Apple added an unlocked version of the iPhone 5 to their online US store, with the 16 GB model starting at US$649.[19][20]

The iPhone 5 was officially discontinued by Apple on September 10, 2013, with the announcement of its successors, the iPhone 5s and the iPhone 5c.[21] While the 5c shared almost the same internal hardware as the iPhone 5, the 5c used a lower-cost polycarbonate plastic case in place of the original 5's aluminum form. The introduction of the 5c deviated from Apple's previous market strategy, where the previous iPhone model would remain in production, but sold at a lower price point below the new model.[21]

On April 28, 2014, Apple initiated an out of warranty recall program to replace any failing power buttons of iPhone 5 models which were manufactured prior to March 2013 at no cost.[22] On August 23, 2014, Apple announced a program to replace batteries of iPhone 5 models that "may suddenly experience shorter battery life or need to be charged more frequently" which were sold between September 2012 and January 2013.[23][24]


Litigation
--------------------------------------------------
Following the release of the iPhone 5, Samsung announced that it was filing a lawsuit against Apple for infringing eight of its patents. The case was scheduled to begin in 2014.[25] In a statement, Samsung said it had "little choice but to take the steps necessary to protect our innovations and intellectual property rights".[26] Litigation between the two involving patent infringement has been ongoing and is being fought in several court cases around the world.[27]


Production
--------------------------------------------------
The components and labor required to construct the most basic iPhone 5 are estimated to cost US$207, which is US$19 more than the cost of components for the corresponding iPhone 4s model. The LTE module in the iPhone 5 alone costs $34, $10 more than the cellular module in the iPhone 4s. Similarly, screens used in the iPhone 5 cost $44, which is $7 more than the screen of its predecessor. Mashable noted that the profit margin of selling each device is "huge" as the iPhone 5 retails for US$649.[28][29]

After the announcement of the device, a lack of supply was evident. This was due to a shortage of components such as the screen. Reports emerged, stating that Sharp was unable to ship the screen before the debut of the iPhone 5, and other manufacturers reported that it was difficult to keep up with demand. As a result, the number of pre-orders rose due to the uncertainty of stock at retail stores, and the delivery dates for pre-orders were postponed to dates that were after the initial release date of the device.[30]


Quality control inspectors strike
--------------------------------------------------
China Labor Watch, a New York State–based NGO, reported that "three to four thousand" Foxconn workers who work at the iPhone 5 production plant in Zhengzhou stopped working on October 5, 2012.[31] The strikes occurred after Apple implemented a stricter quality standard on their products, which includes a 0.02 mm restriction on indentations inflicted during production, and imposed demands related to scratches on frames and back covers.[31] The strikes were also attributed to the employer forcing employees to work on a public holiday. The report stated training was inadequate for quality demands expected and led to employees producing products that did not meet standards. During the strike, conflicts between quality control inspectors and employees resulted in brawls. China Labor Watch also claimed that concerns raised by inspectors were not addressed by factory management.[31] Foxconn spokesmen admitted that a micromanagement problem exists, but also said that there were only 300 to 400 workers absent and the conflicts did not influence production processes.[32] In November 2012 Foxconn chairman Terry Gou reported that the delay in production was due to undisclosed difficulties in assembly.[33]


Features
--------------------------------------------------

Operating system and software
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 5 features iOS, Apple's mobile operating system.[34] The user interface of iOS is based on the concept of direct manipulation, using multi-touch gestures. Interface control elements consist of sliders, switches, and buttons.[35] Interaction with the OS includes gestures such as swipe, tap, pinch, and reverse pinch, all of which have specific definitions within the context of the iOS operating system and its multi-touch interface. Internal accelerometers are used by some applications to respond to shaking the device (one common result is the undo command) or rotating it vertically (one common result is switching from portrait to landscape mode).[35]

The iPhone 5 is shipped with iOS 6, which was released on September 19, 2012.[34] Many of the iPhone 5's features that work specifically with the included iOS 6.0 operating system only worked in certain territories on release.[36] Apple has said this is a rolling program, which will take longer to implement across more regions.[37]

The phone can act as a hotspot, sharing its internet connection over WiFi, Bluetooth, or USB,[38] and also accesses the App Store, an online application distribution platform for iOS developed and maintained by Apple. The service allows users to browse and download applications from the iTunes Store that were developed with Xcode and the iOS SDK and were published through Apple.

The iPhone 5 can play music, movies, television shows, ebooks, audiobooks, and podcasts and can sort its media library by songs, artists, albums, videos, playlists, genres, composers, podcasts, audiobooks, and compilations. Options are always presented alphabetically, except in playlists, which retain their order from iTunes.[39] Users can rotate their device horizontally to landscape mode to access Cover Flow. Like on iTunes, this feature shows the different album covers in a scroll-through photo library. Scrolling is achieved by swiping a finger across the screen. Alternatively, headset controls can be used to pause, play, skip, and repeat tracks. On the iPhone 5, the volume can be changed with the included Apple Earphones, and the Voice Control feature can be used to identify a track, play songs in a playlist or by a specific artist, or create a Genius playlist.[39]

Like the iPhone 4s, the iPhone 5 has Siri,[39] that allows the user to operate the iPhone by spoken commands. The software was improved in iOS 6 to include the ability to make restaurant reservations, launch apps, dictate Facebook or Twitter updates, retrieve movie reviews and detailed sports statistics.[40]

On the iPhone 5, texting can be aided by the voice assistant, which converts speech to text.[39] In addition to regular texting, messaging on the iPhone 5 supports iMessage, a specialized instant messaging program and service that allows unlimited texting to other Apple devices running iOS 5 or later. This supports the inclusion of content such as images and sound in text messages, integration with the device's voice-controlled software assistant, and read acknowledgments for sent messages. Input to the device comes from a keyboard displayed on the multi-touch screen or by voice-to-text by speaking into the microphone. Entered text is supported by predictive and suggestion software; there is a multi-language spell-checker which recognizes many regional accents of different languages.[39]

iOS 6 features several new and/or updated apps, which includes Apple Maps and Passbook. Apple's built-in Maps app, which replaced the former Maps app powered by Google Maps, had been universally derided and lacked many features present in competing maps apps.[41][42] It uses Apple's new vector-based engine that eliminates lag, making for smoother zooming. New to Maps is turn-by-turn navigation spoken directions, 3D views in some major cities and real-time traffic.[40][43] iOS 6 is able to retrieve documents such as boarding passes, admission tickets, coupons and loyalty cards through its new Passbook app. An iOS device with Passbook can be scanned under a reader to process a mobile payment at locations that have compatible hardware. The app has context-aware features such as notifications for relevant coupons when in the immediate vicinity of a given store.[40][44]

Facebook comes integrated through Apple's native apps with iOS 6. Facebook features can be directly accessed from within native apps such as Calendar which can sync Facebook events, or use Facebook's like button from within the Apple App Store.[40]

New privacy settings are available to the user. In addition to location services, the following have been added in iOS 6: photos (already partially restricted in iOS 5), contacts (address book), calendars, reminders, Bluetooth sharing, Twitter, Facebook, and Sina Weibo. iOS 6 also comes with a "Limit ad tracking" user control in the general settings menu to allow users the option to prevent targeted advertising. Apple's Advertising Identifier replaces the company's existing Unique Device Identification (UDID) standard. Advertising networks not yet using Apple's Advertising Identifier device identifier standard would not be affected, although Apple will require the standard in the future.[45]


Design
--------------------------------------------------
Apple emphasized the improved build quality of the iPhone 5 at its press event.[15] The frame used in previous versions was redesigned to use an aluminum composite frame.[46] The iPhone 4 and iPhone 4s used stainless steel instead of aluminium due to Steve Jobs' preference for the metal which he thought, "looks beautiful when it wears".[47]

The iPhone 5 is 18% thinner, 20% lighter, and has 12% less overall volume than its predecessor, the iPhone 4s.[48] The phone's aluminum body is 0.30 in (7.6 mm) thick. At the September 2012 conference Apple claimed it was the thinnest smartphone in the world at 7.6 mm, though that claim was disputed as the Chinese Oppo Finder was thinner and some other smartphones could be considered to be thinner, depending upon where thickness is measured. The Oppo Finder measured 6.65 mm (0.262 in) at its thinnest point and 7.1 mm (0.28 in) at its thickest point making it overall thinner than the iPhone.[49][50][51][52] This design was used three times, first with the iPhone 5 in 2012, then with the 5s in 2013, and finally with the first-generation iPhone SE in 2016.


Hardware
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 5 uses a system on chip (SoC), called the Apple A6.[17][53][54] The SoC comprises a 1.3 GHz dual-core processor, 1 GB of RAM and a tri-core PowerVR SGX543MP4 running at 266 MHz.[55][56] The iPhone 5's operating memory (LPDDR2-1066 eDRAM) was doubled, from 512 MB to 1 GB. Storage capacities available are fixed at 16, 32 or 64 GB, the same as the 4s; plug-in memory cards are not supported.[57] The two color options are black (with black glass and slate-colored metal trim), and white (with white ceramic and silver-colored metal trim); again the same color options (though differently implemented) as its predecessor the 4s had.[58] The iPhone 5 retains the 8 megapixel back camera on the iPhone 4s, but has improved low-light performance, and has a 40% faster photo capture[59] than its predecessors, while having a purple hue when a strong source of light is present in the photograph.[60] The front camera, which is accessible through the FaceTime and camera app has a lower resolution, at 1.2 megapixels. The rechargeable lithium-ion battery with a charge capacity of 1440mAh[9] is built in and cannot be replaced by the user; it is rated at ≤225 hours of standby time and ≤8 hours of talk time. There are three separate models of the phone available: one supporting CDMA and two GSM versions.[61][62] This can have knock-on effects for which version of the device will actually work in which countries/regions.[citation needed] The phone takes a nano-SIM, smaller than the micro-SIM of the iPhone 4 and iPhone 4s.[63]

Hardware benchmarking conducted using Geekbench and GLBenchmark validates several claims that Apple included on their website and mentioned at the unveiling of the device, these include two times faster and two times the graphics performance. In the Geekbench overall hardware assessment, the iPhone 5 received a score that was approximately 2.5 times higher than the iPhone 4s. The benchmark conducted using GLBenchmark for the iPhone 5 returned a score that was 2 times better than the iPhone 4s. The result was however inconsistent as a 3D graphics benchmark assessment using Passmark returned a score that was only approximately 1.45 times better than the iPhone 4s.[64][65] Battery life assessments conducted by AnandTech concluded that the battery life is shorter on the iPhone 5 than its predecessor when performing certain tasks, however when performing other tasks the iPhone 5 battery outlasts the iPhone 4s.[66]

The Retina Display is 1,136 × 640 pixels with an aspect ratio of almost exactly 16:9, (minus one extra row of horizontal pixels). With a diagonal of 4" it has a display size of 6.7 square inches, compared to 5.7 in iPhone 4 and 4s.[67] The pixel density remains the same as the 4s model, which is 326 pixels per inch. Screen icons of the iPhone 5 are arranged in a matrix of six rows of four icons each. The increased screen size allows the sixth row of icons to be added to the five rows that were present in the iPhone 4. In-cell touch sensor technology from Sharp slims the screen which allows for a thinner phone. The screen's color saturation is 44% greater than its predecessor.[68]

There are three microphones (placed on the front, side and back) for noise cancellation and video calls.[69]

On April 28, 2014, Apple initiated an out of warranty recall program to replace any failing power buttons of iPhone 5 models which were manufactured prior to March 2013 at no cost.[22]

On August 23, 2014, Apple announced a program to replace batteries of iPhone 5 models that "may suddenly experience shorter battery life or need to be charged more frequently" which were sold between September 2012 and January 2013.[23][24]


Accessories
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 5, as well as the iPod Touch (5th generation), iPod Nano (7th generation), iPad (4th generation), and iPad Mini feature a new dock connector named Lightning, which replaces the 30-pin Apple Dock connector introduced in 2003 by Apple on the iPod (3rd generation). The Apple Lightning connector has eight pins and all signaling is digital. This new connector is smaller than the previous one, helping the iPhone 5 to be slimmer than its predecessors.[70] Apple Lightning cables have duplicate pins on two sides of each plug, so it can be inserted either way round. Various accessories will be available to convert the Apple Lightning connector to the older 30-pin Apple Dock connector or USB,[71] although not all old accessories will work, as not all signals are available, in particular video output and the iPod Out feature for BMW automobiles.[72][73][74]

Earphones known as Apple EarPods are included with the iPhone 5 and other devices announced at the Apple media event on September 12, 2012. They superseded earphones that were included with previous generation iPhones and iPods.[75] According to technology commentators, the redesign of the earphones is aimed to improve sound quality by allowing air to travel in and out more freely.[76][77] Apple states that the redesign of their earphones allows it to "rival high-end headphones that cost hundreds of dollars more".[76] Reviews by Gizmodo and TechRadar reported that although the redesigned earphones sounded better than its predecessor, reviewers felt that quality of sound produced is poor.[78]


Network compatibility
--------------------------------------------------
AT&T, Verizon, and Sprint offer LTE access in the US,[84] while in the UK, only EE and Three are able to offer LTE access.[85] On March 26, 2013, T-Mobile announced they would begin carrying the iPhone 5, making it the first iPhone to be available on all four nationwide carriers in the United States.[86] The T-Mobile version of the iPhone features a modified version of the A1428 iPhone 5 model enabling Advanced Wireless Services (AWS) support.[87] All carriers in Canada selling the iPhone 5 have their own LTE networks, including Rogers Wireless, Fido Solutions, Bell Mobility, Virgin Mobile Canada, Telus Mobility and Koodo Mobile.[88][89]

42 officially recognized bands exist for LTE, however rollouts are coalescing around the more-popular bands, based on what historically has been made available in specific regions. In Europe, bands available for LTE include, 2.6 GHz (the 3G-expansion band) and 800 MHz (cleared of analogue TV), with 1,800 MHz appearing in a few places including the UK. In Germany, the only carrier network supported is that of T-Mobile with its 1,800 MHz band allocated to LTE.[90][91] Some countries in Europe, including Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and others—will not be able to offer LTE connectivity via the iPhone 5 to their customers on their current LTE networks, as they have already deployed LTE in the 2.6 GHz band, which the iPhone 5 does not support.[92] In November 2012, a representative of Swisscom reported that the iPhone 5 only supports LTE on networks that have been tested and certified by Apple.[93][94]

Unlike the iPhone 4s, which was the only "world phone" produced by Apple, there are three versions of the iPhone 5, which differ by the frequency used. All three work on 2G GSM/GPRS and 3G UMTS/EDGE networks on both the 800 and 1900 MHz bands used in the Americas, and the 900 and 1800 MHz bands used elsewhere. The CDMA A1429 model works on CDMA networks, such as that of Sprint and Verizon. Another version supports LTE only on the 1700/2100 MHz AWS band, and the 700 MHz band recovered after the conversion to digital television in the US (channels 52 to 56), currently the only network that supports the band is AT&T. GSM A1429 supports several other LTE bands available in other countries, such as LTE bands 1, 3, 5.[62][95]


Reception
--------------------------------------------------

Critical reception
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 5 received mainly positive reviews from commentators and reviewers. Tim Stevens from Engadget praised the iPhone 5 for its high resolution screen surpassing that of the iPhone 4s, which he considered to be one of the best phone screens available on the market. Stevens was critical of the new connector, which is incompatible with devices and cables that use the superseded 30-pin connector, although the LA Times reported that this was a change necessary to make the device smaller than its predecessor.[70] Engadget agreed that Apple fulfilled most of the promises stated on its website, such as "better battery performance", "two times the graphics performance" and "two times faster."[96] David Pogue of The New York Times considered the 4-inch Retina display a "nice but not life-changing change", and praised the Lightning connector for its size, sturdiness, and reversibility, while noting its lack of support for older accessories, remarking that "Apple has a long history of killing off technologies, inconveniently and expensively, that the public had come to love".[97] Technology columnist Ed Baig of USA Today was impressed that Apple had met the public's "lofty expectations" for the iPhone 5 in a competitive market.[98] In a repair-ability review, iFixit found the iPhone 5 easier to disassemble and repair than its predecessor.[9][99]

Wired reported that the iPhone 5 design, carried on in the iPhone 5s and first-generation iPhone SE, was regarded as "long been the golden child of Apple phone design and a benchmark for phones in general", while the succeeding iPhone 6/6s design was less critically acclaimed as it "felt a little bit wrong, as though you were holding a slick $650 bar of soap". Wired described the iPhone 5 as "elegance rooted in the way the aluminum and glass work together. It felt streamlined, yet substantial, which is different from the iPhone 6, which feels substantial in size alone. Plus, unlike the ubiquitous rounded corners of the 6, the iPhone 5 didn't really look like anything else on the market at the time". However, the iPhone 5's design was not suited to scaling up, in contrast to the iPhone 6/6s which could better accommodate the growing consumer trend towards larger screen sizes and indeed spawned the 6/6S Plus phablet models.[100][101]


Criticism
--------------------------------------------------
Reviewers and commentators were critical of the new Maps app that replaced Google Maps in iOS 6. It had been reported to contain errors such as misplacement of landmark tags, directing users to incorrect locations and poor satellite images.[102][103][104] Nine days after Maps' release, Apple issued a statement apologizing for the frustration it had caused customers and recommending that they try alternate mapping services.[105]


Errors
--------------------------------------------------
Gizmodo editor Diaz discussed the correspondence between Apple and a reader about purple flare in pictures taken on iPhone 5 camera. Apple's response to the issue was that it is normal and advised the customer to aim the camera away from bright light sources when taking photos.[106] Tests conducted by TechCrunch indicate that the problem existed on the iPhone 4s but was more distinct and pronounced on the iPhone 5.[107] Consumer Reports found that the purple haze effect occurred on several other manufacturers' phones including the Samsung Galaxy S III and Motorola Droid Razr Maxx, and that it was not less pronounced on the iPhone 4s. The report concluded that digital cameras in general, including higher-end SLRs, can all suffer from lens flare in which a purple-tinted effect was not uncommon.[108]


Problems
--------------------------------------------------
There were anecdotal claims of the coating of primarily black iPhone 5s chipping off, exposing the bright aluminium underneath. Apple executive's response to email correspondence from an affected customer summarized that it was normal for aluminum to scratch.[109][110] The term "scuffgate", a reference to "antennagate" which affected the iPhone 4, was applied by various sources such as CNET, Yahoo News, and All Things Digital to describe the scuffing issue.[111][112]

Some users reported on the Internet that the white model leaked light behind the screen, though the issue was not unique to the iPhone 5, as it also affected other Apple devices.[113]


Commercial reception
--------------------------------------------------
Techcrunch reported that the iPhone 5 sold out twenty times faster than the 4 and 4s models. Apple said that they were "blown away by the customer response".[114] Phil Schiller, Apple's vice-president of worldwide marketing, said that over two million iPhone 5 orders had been received in the first 24 hours.[5][115] AT&T said that the iPhone 5 was the fastest-selling iPhone the company had ever offered, selling over five million units on launch weekend and exceeding the supply available.[6][116][117] The release and sale of the iPhone 5 has also slowed down the growth of Android according to market share reports released by Kantar Worldpanel ComTech.[118] During the first 16 days after the phone's initial release it comprised over 20% of all phones sold in that period.[119]

J.P. Morgan's chief economist, Michael Feroli said that "sales of iPhone 5 could boost annualized US GDP growth by $3.2 billion, or $12.8 billion at an annual rate."[120] Shortly after the announcement of the iPhone 5 and preceding the launch, Apple's stock price rose to a record $705.07,[121] but within three months fell to $507.48.[122] According to the analysis of Eric Savitz, Apple's stock decline and resulting losses were not the result of any issue with the new Maps application, but disappointed investors. He points to initial hardware sales of only five million, compared to projections up to twice that, as the primary cause.[123]

Since the release of the iPhone 5, discounts on previous generation iPhones have enabled Apple to maintain a market lead in the United States and Japan, but the iPhone continued to lag behind the combined total of Android phones in the global market.[124]

List of iPhone models

The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are smartphones that were developed and marketed by Apple Inc. They are the eighth generation of the iPhone, succeeding the iPhone 5, iPhone 5c and iPhone 5s, and were announced on September 9, 2014, and released on September 19, 2014.[20] The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus jointly were themselves replaced as the flagship devices of the iPhone series by the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus on September 9, 2015. The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus include larger 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch displays, a faster processor, upgraded cameras, improved LTE and Wi-Fi connectivity and support for a near-field communications-based mobile payments offering.[21][22]

The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus received positive reviews, with critics regarding their redesign, specifications, camera, and battery life as being improvements over previous iPhone models. However, aspects of the design of iPhone 6 were also criticized, including plastic strips on the rear of the device for its antenna that disrupted the otherwise metal exterior, and the screen resolution of the standard-sized iPhone 6 being lower than other devices in its class. The iPhone 6 sold extremely well, making it the best-selling iPhone model and the most successful smartphone to date.

The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus have been the subject of several hardware issues, including most prominently, being susceptible to bending under hard pressure (dubbed "Bendgate"), and as a byproduct of this lack of rigidity, the touchscreen's internal hardware being susceptible to losing its connection to the phone's logic board (nicknamed "Touch Disease"). Additionally, some iPhone 6 Plus models were the subject of camera issues, including some with malfunctioning optical image stabilization or otherwise defects on rear cameras.

The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were moved to the midrange spot in Apple's iPhone lineup when the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus were released in September 2015. The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were discontinued in most markets on September 7, 2016, when Apple announced the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Their spot as the entry-level iPhone was replaced by the first-generation iPhone SE, which was released earlier on March 31, 2016. The iPhone 6 was relaunched with 32 GB of storage in Asian markets in February 2017 as a midrange/budget iPhone. It was later expanded to Europe,[23][24] before hitting the US markets in May 2017,[25] and Canada in July 2017.[26] The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus supported iOS 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 before being dropped by iOS 13, and they are the third to support five versions of iOS after the iPhone 4s and the iPhone 5.


History
--------------------------------------------------
From the launch of the original iPhone to the iPhone 4s, iPhones used 3.5-inch displays—which are smaller than screens used by flagship phones from competitors. The iPhone 5 and its immediate successors featured a display that was taller, but the same width as prior models, measuring at 4 inches diagonally. Following Apple's loss in smartphone market share to companies producing phones with larger displays, reports as early as January 2014 suggested Apple was preparing to launch new iPhone models with larger, 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch displays.[27][28][29] Reports prior to its unveiling also speculated Apple might use a new iPhone model to introduce a mobile payments platform using near-field communications—a technology that was incorporated into many Android phones, but had experienced a low adoption rate among users.[30]

The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus were officially unveiled during a press event at the Flint Center for Performing Arts in Cupertino, California on September 9, 2014, and released on September 19, 2014; pre-orders began on September 12, 2014, with the iPhone 6 starting at US$199 and the iPhone 6 Plus starting at US$299.[31] In China, where the iPhone 5c and 5s were the first models in the iPhone series to be released in the country on the same day as their international launch, Apple notified local wireless carriers it would be unable to release the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus on the 19th there were "details which are not ready"; local media reported the devices had not yet been approved by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, and earlier in the year, a news report by state broadcaster China Central Television alleged iPhone devices were a threat to national security because iOS 7's "frequent locations" function could expose "state secrets."[32][33]

In August 2015, Apple initiated a replacement program for some early iPhone 6 Plus models that were found to have potentially faulty cameras that could be causing photos to appear blurry.[34][35][36]

On September 9, 2015, with the release of the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were moved to the mid-range of the iPhone lineup. The 128 GB versions of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus was discontinued along with the gold version of both phones, but the 16 GB and 64 GB versions of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in silver and space gray remained available for sale at a reduced price.[37]

In June 2016, Apple faced a potential sales ban in China, as Shenzhen Baili, a Chinese device maker, alleged the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus infringed on its design patent.[38]

The iPhone 6 was temporary discontinued on September 7, 2016, and the 6 Plus was permanently discontinued on same date, when Apple announced the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, and the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus' spot as the entry-level iPhone was taken by the first-generation iPhone SE. As the iPhone SE has more powerful internal hardware than the midrange iPhone 6 (largely the same as the 6S) and had been released earlier on March 31, 2016, this created an unusual situation when it was sold alongside the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus until September 7 despite being marketed as a lower-tier iPhone.

In February 2017, the iPhone 6 was quietly relaunched in carrier stores and online, this time the storage has been changed to 32 GB. In India, it was sold on Amazon's website in Space Grey. In Taiwan, it was sold through Taiwan Mobile on March 10 in gold color. In mid-March, it was released in the EU to Belarus via the i-Store webshop. It also makes an appearance in North America with Sprint based US prepaid carriers Boost Mobile and Virgin Mobile, along with AT&T GoPhone. These are not being distributed by Apple on their website or their retail stores.


Specifications
--------------------------------------------------

Hardware
--------------------------------------------------

Design
--------------------------------------------------
The design of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus is influenced by that of the iPad Air with a glass front that is curved around the edges of the display, and an aluminum rear that contains two plastic strips for the antenna.[39] The back is built of 6000-series aluminum.[40] Both models come in gold, silver, and "space gray" finishes. The iPhone 6 has a thickness of 6.9 millimetres (0.27 in), while the iPhone 6 Plus is 7.1 mm (0.28 in) in thickness; both are thinner than the iPhone 5c and iPhone 5s, with the iPhone 6 being Apple's thinnest phone to date.


Displays
--------------------------------------------------
The most significant changes to the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are its displays; both branded as "Retina HD Display" and "ion-strengthened", the iPhone 6 display is 4.7 inches in size with a 16:9 resolution of 1334x750 (326 ppi, minus one row of pixels), while the iPhone 6 Plus includes a 5.5-inch 1920x1080 (1080p) display (401 PPI). The displays use a multiple-domain LCD panel, dubbed "dual-domain pixels"; the RGB pixels themselves are skewed in a pattern so every pixel is seen from a different angle. This technique helps improve the viewing angles of the display.[41]

To accommodate the larger physical size of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, the top button was renamed to "side button" and moved to the side of the phone instead of the top to improve its accessibility.[21][22]


Batteries
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 6 features a 6.91 Wh (1,810 mAh) battery, while the iPhone 6 Plus features an 11.1 Wh (2,915 mAh) battery, neither of which are user-replaceable.[citation needed]


Chipsets
--------------------------------------------------
Both models include an Apple A8 system-on-chip, and an M8 motion co-processor—an update of the M7 chip from the iPhone 5s. The primary difference between the M8 and the original M7 coprocessor is the M8 also includes a barometer to measure altitude changes. Phil Schiller said the A8 chip would provide, in comparison to the 5s, a 25% increase in CPU performance, a 50% increase in graphics performance, and less heat output. Early hands-on reports said the A8's GPU performance might indeed break away from previous generations doubling of performance at each yearly release, scoring 21204.26 in Base mark X compared to 20253.80, 10973.36 and 5034.75 on respectively the 5s, 5 and 4s.[42]


Connectivity
--------------------------------------------------
The expanded LTE connectivity on the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus is improved to LTE Advanced, with support for over 20 LTE bands (seven more than the iPhone 5s),[43] for up to 150 Mbit/s download speed, and VoLTE support. Wi-Fi performance has been improved with support for 802.11ac specifications, providing speeds up to 433.0581 Mbit/s—which is up to three times faster than 802.11n,[43] along with Wi-Fi Calling support where available. The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus adds support for near-field communications (NFC). It is initially used exclusively for Apple Pay—a new mobile payments system which allows users to store their credit cards in Passbook for use with online payments and retail purchases over NFC.[44][45] iOS 11 added limited use of near-field communications besides Apple Pay for 3rd party apps.[46]


Camera
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 6's rear-facing camera now has the ability to shoot 1080p Full HD video at either 30 or 60 frames per second and 720p HD slow-motion video at either 120 or 240 frames per second, while the iPhone 5s could only record at 30 and 120 frames per second respectively.[citation needed] Unlike the previous models, the rear-facing camera is not flush with the rear of the device, but instead protrudes slightly.[47]

Still photos can be captured during video recording. Those have a resolution of four megapixels (2720×1532).[48][49]

The camera also includes phase detection autofocus.[50] The iPhone 6 Plus camera is nearly identical, but also includes optical image stabilization.[21][22] The front-facing camera was also updated with a new sensor and f/2.2 aperture, along with support for burst and HDR modes.[21][22]

However, the optical image stabilization of the iPhone 6 Plus is only available for photography and deactivated during video recording.[14]

The front camera has 1.3 Megapixels and records video up to 720p at 30 frames per second.[12]


Sensors
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus are the first iPhones to be equipped with a barometer sensor.[51]

Like the predecessor, the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus are equipped with an accelerometer, gyroscope, front-facing proximity sensor and a digital compass.[12]


Software
--------------------------------------------------
When first released, the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus were supplied pre-loaded with iOS 8. Apps are able to take advantage of the increased screen size in the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus to display more information on-screen; for example, the Mail app uses a dual-pane layout similar to its iPad version when the device is in landscape mode on the iPhone 6 Plus. As it uses an identical aspect ratio, apps designed for the iPhone 5, iPhone 5c, and 5s can be upscaled for use on the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. To improve the usability of the devices' larger screens, an additional "Reachability" gesture was added; double-tapping the Home button will slide the top half of the screen's contents down to the bottom half of the screen. This function allows users to reach buttons located near the top of the screen, such as a "Back" button in the top-left corner.[21][22] Tapping it once resets the screen timeout so the user does not have to look at the screen for an empty spot to tap on.[52]

In June 2019, Apple announced that it would drop support for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus with the release of iOS 13.[53][54][55]


Reception
--------------------------------------------------
Both iPhone 6 models received positive reviews. Re/code called it "the best smartphone you can buy".[56] TechRadar praised the iPhone 6's "brilliant" design, improved battery life over the 5s, iOS 8 for being "smarter and more intuitive than ever", along with the quality of its camera. However, the plastic antenna strips on the rear of the phone were criticized for resulting in poor aesthetics, the display for having lower resolution and pixel density in comparison to other recent smartphones – including those with the same physical screen size as the iPhone 6, such as the HTC One, and for not having a sufficient justification for its significantly higher price in comparison to similar devices running Android or Windows Phone.[57] The Verge considered the iPhone 6 to be "simply and cleanly designed" in comparison to the 5s, noting the phone still felt usable despite its larger size, but criticized the antenna plastic, the protruding camera lens (which prevents the device from sitting flat without a case), and the lack of additional optimization in the operating system for the bigger screen. Improvements such as performance, battery life, VoLTE support, and other tweaks were also noted. In conclusion, the iPhone 6 was considered "good, even great, but there's little about it that's truly ambitious or truly moving the needle. It's just a refinement of a lot of existing ideas into a much more pleasant package".[39]

In regards to the 6 Plus, Engadget panned its design for being uncomfortable to hold and harder to grip in comparison to other devices such as the Galaxy Note 3 and LG G3, but praised its inclusion of optical image stabilization and slightly better battery life than the 6.[50]

The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus have been criticized by Forbes Magazine for the lack of 2160p (3840×2160 pixels) video recording due to the insufficient image sensor resolution of 3264×2448 pixels. However, third-party software is able to record footage at 3264×1836 pixels upscaled to 3840×2160p.[58]


Issues
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were affected by a number of notable hardware-related issues, including but not limited to concerns surrounding their rigidity (which led to incidents surrounding chassis bending, as well as degradation or outright loss of touchscreen functionality), performance issues on models with larger storage capacity, camera problems on the 6 Plus model, as well as an initially undocumented "error 53" that appeared under certain circumstances.




Bendgate (chassis bending)
--------------------------------------------------
Shortly after its public release, it was reported the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus chassis was susceptible to bending under pressure, such as when carried tightly in a user's pocket. While such issues are not exclusive to the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, the design flaw came to be known among users and the media as "Bendgate".[59][60]

Apple responded to the bending allegations, stating they had only received nine complaints of bent devices and that the damage occurring due to regular use is "extremely rare." The company maintained the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus went through durability testing to ensure they would stand up to daily use.[61] The company offered to replace phones that were bent if it is determined the bending was unintentional.[59]

In May 2018, as part of a lawsuit against Apple regarding touchscreen failure, it was revealed via internal documents that Apple knew the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus phones were more likely to bend than previous models. According to the court documents, Apple's internal tests found the iPhone 6 was 3.3 times more likely to bend than the iPhone 5s, while the larger iPhone 6 Plus was 7.2 times more likely to bend.[62][63]


Hair ripping
--------------------------------------------------
On October 3, 2014 9to5Mac released a post claiming certain iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus users complained on social networking sites the phone ripped off their hair when they held the phone close to their ears when making phone calls.[64] Twitter users claimed the seam between the glass screen and aluminum back of the iPhone 6 was to blame, with hair becoming caught within it.[65][66]


Flash storage performance
--------------------------------------------------
Some users reported the 64 and 128 GB iPhone 6 models had experienced performance issues, and that some 128 GB iPhone 6 Plus models would, in rare cases, randomly crash and reboot. Business Korea reported the issues were connected to the triple-level cell NAND storage of the affected models. Triple-level NAND flash can store three bits of data per cell of flash, and are cheaper than dual-level cell solutions, but at the cost of performance. It was reported Apple had planned to switch the affected model lines back to multi-level cell flash, and address the performance issues on existing devices in a future iOS update.[67][68][69]


iPhone 6/6 Plus camera issues
--------------------------------------------------
It was reported the optical image stabilization systems on some iPhone 6 Plus models were faulty, failing to properly stabilize when the phone is being held perfectly still, leading to blurry photos and "wavy"-looking videos.[70] The optical image stabilization system was also found to have been affected by accessories that use magnets, such as third-party lens attachments; Apple issued advisories to users and its licensed accessory makers, warning magnetic or metallic accessories can cause the OIS to malfunction.[71]

On August 21, 2015, Apple instituted a repair program for iPhone 6 Plus models released between September 2014 and January 2015, citing faulty rear cameras on affected models may produce blurry pictures.[34][35][36]

Some iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus models have an issue in which the front-facing camera is somehow "shifted", or out of place. Apple stated they would replace most affected iPhone 6 models with this issue, free of charge. Despite numerous complaints regarding this issue, it does not seem to affect the camera itself. It is said the camera is not what has shifted, but a piece of protective foam around the camera module itself that has gone out of place.[72]


"Error 53"
--------------------------------------------------
If the iPhone 6 home button is repaired or modified by a third party, the device will fail security checks related to Touch ID as the components have not been "re-validated" for security reasons—a process that can only be performed by an authorized Apple outlet. Failing these checks disables all features related to Touch ID. Such effects have sometimes happened as a result of damage as well.[73][74]

It was reported these same hardware integrity checks would trigger an unrecoverable loop into "Recovery Mode" if iOS is updated or restored, with attempts to restore the device via iTunes software resulting in an "error 53" message. Beyond the explanation this is related to hardware integrity errors regarding Touch ID components, Apple provided no official explanation of what specifically triggers error 53 or how it can be fixed without replacing the entire device.[73][74]

On February 18, 2016, Apple released an iOS 9.2.1 patch through iTunes which addresses this issue and admitted error 53 was actually related to a diagnostic check for inspecting the Touch ID hardware before an iPhone is shipped from its factories.[75]


Touchscreen failure ("touch disease")
--------------------------------------------------
Touchscreen control components on iPhone 6 logic boards have insufficient support, including a lack of underfill—which strengthens and stabilizes integrated circuits, and a lack of rigid metal shielding on the logic board unlike previous iPhone models; the touchscreen controller is instead shielded by a flexible "sticker". Normal use of the device can cause the logic board to flex internally, which strains the touchscreen IC connectors and leads to a degradation or outright loss of touchscreen functionality. A symptom that has been associated with this type of failure is a flickering grey bar near the top of the display.[76][77] iFixit reported this issue, nicknamed "touch disease",[76][78][79] was a byproduct of the previous "Bendgate" design flaw because of the device's demonstrated lack of rigidity. As such, the larger iPhone 6 Plus is more susceptible to the flaw, but it has also been reported on a small percentage of iPhone 6 models.[79][80][81] The devices' successor, the iPhone 6s, is not afflicted by this flaw due to changes to their internal design, which included the strengthening of "key points" in the rear casing, and the re-location of the touchscreen controllers to the display assembly from the logic board.[80]

Initially, Apple did not officially acknowledge this issue. The issue was widely discussed on Apple's support forum—where posts discussing the issue have been subject to censorship.[77] The touchscreen can be repaired via microsoldering: Apple Stores are not equipped with the tools needed to perform the logic board repair, which had led to affected users sending their devices to unofficial, third-party repair services. An Apple Store employee interviewed by Apple Insider reported six months after they first started noticing the problem, Apple had issued guidance instructing them to tell affected users this was a hardware issue that could not be repaired and that their iPhone had to be replaced. However, some in-stock units have also been afflicted with this issue out of the box, leading to an employee stating they were "tired of pulling service stock out of the box, and seeing the exact same problem the customer has on the replacement".[81][82] The issue received mainstream attention in August 2016 when reported by iFixit.[76][79][81] On August 26, 2016, Apple Insider reported based on data from four "high-traffic" Apple Store locations, there was a spike in the number of iPhone 6 devices brought into them for repairs following mainstream reports of the "touch disease" problem.[82]

On August 30, 2016, a group of three iPhone 6 owners sued Apple Inc. in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California and filed for a proposed class action lawsuit, alleging Apple was engaging in unfair business practices by having "long been aware" of the defective design, yet refusing to acknowledge or repair it.[78][83][84]

On November 17, 2016, Apple officially acknowledged the issue and announced a paid repair program for affected iPhone 6 Plus models, stating; "some iPhone 6 Plus devices may exhibit display flickering or Multi-Touch issues after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device".[85]


Sales
--------------------------------------------------
Apple Inc. announced, within 24 hours of availability, over 4 million pre-orders of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were made, exceeding the supply available—an Apple record.[86] 10 million iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus devices were sold in the first three days, marking another Apple record. The iPhone 6S & 6S Plus were introduced in September 2015 selling 13 million units which set the record for sales in the first three days from last years release.[87] Three months after its release, the iPhone 6 generated 71.5 million unit sales.[88]

As of June 2017, the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus have sold 222.4 million units worldwide, making them the most popular iPhone models and the best-selling smartphones of all time.[89][88]

List of iPhone models

The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus[a] are smartphones that were developed and marketed by Apple Inc. They are the tenth generation of the iPhone. They were announced on September 7, 2016, at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco by Apple CEO Tim Cook, and were released on September 16, 2016, succeeding the iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus as the flagship devices in the iPhone series. Apple also released the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in numerous countries worldwide throughout September and October 2016. They were succeeded as flagship devices by the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus[12] on September 12, 2017, and were discontinued with the announcement of the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro on September 10, 2019.

The iPhone 7's overall design is similar to the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S. Changes introduced included new color options (Matte Black and Jet Black), water and dust resistance, a new capacitive, static home button, revised antenna bands, and the controversial removal of the 3.5 mm headphone jack. The device's internal hardware received upgrades, including a heterogeneous quad-core system-on-chip with improved system and graphics performance, upgraded 12 megapixel rear-facing cameras with optical image stabilization on all models, and an additional telephoto lens exclusive to the iPhone 7 Plus to provide enhanced (2x) optical zoom capabilities and portrait mode. The front camera is the first in the series with 1080p (Full HD) video resolution. The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus were supported from iOS 10 to iOS 15, and they are the third to support six versions of iOS before support was terminated, after the iPhone 5s.

The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus were the last iPhones using a quad-core CPU, as well as an aluminum unibody design without wireless charging and a base model starting at 32 GB of internal storage.

The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus were the only iPhones to have a jet black color finish.


History
--------------------------------------------------
Prior to its announcement, multiple aspects of the iPhone 7 were heavily rumoured. Apple's plans to remove the 3.5 mm headphone jack received significant media attention.[b] Other rumors included a flush camera, stereo speakers,[17] a 256 gigabyte storage option, and a larger 3,100 mAh battery.[18]

On August 29, 2016, invitations to a press event at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco, California on September 7, 2016, were sent out to members of the media, prompting immediate speculation of the iPhone 7's upcoming announcement.[19][20] The iPhone 7 was officially announced at that event, with pre-orders beginning September 9, and general availability on September 16.[21][22][23]

The iPhone 7 launched in 30 new countries later in September, with further international rollouts throughout October and November 2016.[c] Indonesia was the last country to release the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, with availability starting on March 31, 2017, following Apple's research and development investment in the country.[31]

On March 21, 2017, Apple announced an iPhone 7 with a red color finish (and white front), as part of its partnership with Product Red to highlight its AIDS fundraising campaign. It launched on March 24, 2017,[32][33] but it was later discontinued after the announcement of the iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X in September 2017 as well as the 256 GB Variant.[34]

On September 12, 2017, Apple announced the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus as direct successors to the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus,[35] alongside the iPhone X.[36]

The iPhone 7 & 7 Plus, as well as the iPhone XS and its Max variant were discontinued and removed from Apple's website after the announcement of the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro on September 10, 2019. They are no longer available for sale.

On June 6, 2022, Apple announced on its website that the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus will not receive support for iOS 16. Controversially, the iPad (5th generation), which has the A9 chip, received iPadOS 16, along with the 6th and 7th generation iPads, which have almost identical hardware to the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus respectively.[37]


Specifications
--------------------------------------------------

Design
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 7's exterior is similar in shape and volume to the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S, although the camera bump is bigger on the iPhone 7. Alongside the existing silver, gold, and rose gold colors, the device is offered in new colors of matte black, glossy "jet black",[21] and, for a limited time, red.[32][33] The "jet black" color is a dark shade, high-gloss black finish. It is created through a multi-step process, beginning with an anodization phase to make the surface of the casing a porous aluminum oxide, and then using a machine to sweep the casing through a powdered compound, absorbed by aluminum oxide. The process is concluded with an "ultrafine particle bath" for additional finishing; the entire process takes less than an hour.[38]


Water protection
--------------------------------------------------
iPhone 7 is rated IP67 water and dust resistant, making it the first officially water-resistant iPhone,[39] although tests have resulted in malfunctions, specifically distorted speakers, after water exposure.[40] The warranty does not cover any water damage to the phone.[41]


Home button
--------------------------------------------------
iPhone 7's home button uses a capacitive mechanism for input rather than a physical push-button, as on previous models, meaning direct skin contact (or a capacitive glove) is required to operate the device.[42][43] Physical feedback is provided via a Taptic Engine vibrator, and the button is also pressure-sensitive.[44] iPhone 7 retains the 3D Touch display system introduced on the iPhone 6S, providing pressure-sensitive touchscreen input.[21]


Headphone plug removal
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are the first iPhones not to feature a 3.5mm headphone jack. It was replaced by a second speaker grille that serves as a vent for the internal barometer.[45] A Lightning-to-3.5-mm-connector adapter, as well as in-ear headphones that use the Lightning connector, were bundled with the device,[21] and the adapter is also sold separately as an accessory.[46] The adapter is also compatible with other iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch devices running iOS 10 and newer.[47]


Hardware
--------------------------------------------------

Chipsets
--------------------------------------------------
iPhone 7 uses the Apple A10 Fusion 64-bit system-on-chip, which consists of two low-power cores and two high-power cores (only two cores are used at any point in time[48]). The A10 chip also features a hexa-core graphics chip capable of "console-level gaming".[49] As with prior models, iPhone 7 is available in two sizes: one with a 4.7 in (120 mm) screen, and a "Plus" variant with a 5.5 in (140 mm) screen.[50] The displays have identical sizes and resolutions to iPhone 6S, but with a wider color gamut[21] and increased brightness.[51] The screen-to-body ratio is about ~66% and ~68% for the 7 and 7 Plus, respectively.[52][53]

Both device variants also contain a new iteration of Apple's motion coprocessor, the M10.[54] Unlike previous iPhone models, internal storage options for iPhone 7 begin at 32 GB instead of 16 GB, and max out at 256 GB.[55] iPhone 7 Plus offers 3 GB of RAM, more than any other previous iPhone;[48] the 4.7-inch iPhone 7 has 2 GB.[56]


Cameras
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 7 includes a 12-megapixel rear-facing camera with a quad-LED "True Tone" flash; its aperture was widened to f/1.8, and the standard-size phone model adds optical image stabilization – a feature that was previously exclusive to Plus models.[57]

The iPhone 7 Plus includes a second 12-megapixel telephoto lens, which can be used to achieve 2× optical zoom, and up to 10× digital zoom. However, the telephoto camera has an f/2.8 aperture and lacks optical image stabilization.[58]

The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus record video with single-channel mono audio.[59]

Still photos with 6.5 megapixels (3412×1920) can be captured during video recording.[60]

The front-facing camera was upgraded to a 7-megapixel sensor with automatic image stabilization.[21][61]

The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are the first iPhones to be able to record 1080p video using the front camera.[62]


Battery life
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 7 has a 1,960 mAh battery which can last about 3–5 hours. The iPhone 7 Plus has 2,900 mAh battery and can last for 5–8 hours.


Software
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 7 originally shipped with iOS 10 pre-installed.[63] The iPhone 7 Plus received an exclusive portrait camera mode in the iOS 10.1 software update.[64] This camera mode is capable of producing a bokeh effect using depth of field analysis of the second camera of dual-lens in the back of iPhone 7 Plus. Mainstream software support for the iPhone 7 was dropped when iOS 16 was released.[65][66] But, it still receives iOS 15 security updates (as of January 22, 2024). The current version of iOS to support iPhone 7 is iOS 15.8.3.[67] The device can also run Android 10 unofficially via a project called Project Sandcastle made by Corellium, a security research company that produces paid iOS, Android, and IoT emulators.[68] Ubuntu 20.04 "Focal Fossa" has also been ported via Project Sandcastle.[69]


Accessories
--------------------------------------------------
Each iPhone 7 originally came with a Lightning-to-3.5-mm adapter,[21] although this was omitted starting on September 12, 2018.[70] Apple sells the adapter independently as well.[46] iPhone 7 does not have a built-in DAC, a Cirrus Logic CS4272 DAC is included as part of the adapter. Apple also unveiled several Bluetooth wireless headphones ostensibly intended for use with the iPhone 7, including AirPods, wireless in-ear headphones, and three new Beats headphone products. All four products utilize an in-house wireless chip known as the Apple W1, which is designed to provide low-power Bluetooth operation and integration with iOS and macOS devices (though they are still compatible with other Bluetooth-supported devices).[71][72]


Reception
--------------------------------------------------
Reception of the iPhone 7 was mixed. Although reviewers noted improvements to the camera, especially the dual rear camera on the Plus model, the phone was criticized for the lack of innovation in its build quality. Many reviews panned the removal of the 3.5 mm headphone jack; some critics argued that the change was meant to bolster licensing of the proprietary Lightning connector and the sales of Apple's own wireless headphone products, and questioned the effects of the change on audio quality. Apple was also mocked by critics for Phil Schiller's statement that such a drastic change required "courage".

Gordon Kelly of Forbes noted that rival smartphones, such as the Samsung Galaxy S7, had increased battery life and added water resistance over its predecessor while retaining the headphone jack, and that the iPhone 7's camera photo quality was improved but still lagging behind some phones already on the market, including the Galaxy S7 and Nexus 6P. Kelly praised how Apple was able to extract improved brightness and accurate color reproduction from its LCD display panel, while noting that it was old technology which was also well behind rivals who had already moved to sharper 1080p or even 2K screens. The iPhone 7's exterior, which reuses the aging design of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S, was criticized, especially the size of the device and thick top/bottom bezels, with Kelly writing that "the iPhone 7 Plus is simply far too big for a smartphone with a 5.5-inch display".[73]

Nilay Patel of The Verge described the device as being "full of aggressive breaks from convention," noting the headphone jack removal, heterogeneous CPU, and home button redesign, going as far as dubbing it "a prototype of next year's rumored drastic iPhone redesign disguised as an iPhone 6." The display quality was considered an improvement over previous models, albeit "not as insane" as the quad HD displays on competing phones. The Taptic Engine was considered the "first really valuable new UI concept I've seen on phones in years" (as opposed to the "gimmick" of 3D Touch), Patel felt that the cameras of the devices were a step above the 6S in terms of performance, and praised the dual-lens camera on the 7 Plus for enhancing the phone's camera functionality. However, he panned the lack of editing features that made use of them. In regards to the enhanced Bluetooth audio support provided by devices containing the W1 chip, he argued that Apple "took away an established open standard in favor of new technologies, but instead of making the experience of using those new technologies better across the board, it made every third-party wireless audio product a second-class citizen of the Apple ecosystem." Giving the iPhone 7 a 9 out of 10, he concluded that the devices were "legitimately among the most interesting, opinionated, powerful phones Apple has ever shipped, and the most confident expressions of the company's vision in a long time. iOS 10 is excellent, the cameras are better, and the performance is phenomenal. And the batteries last longer."[74]

John McCann of TechRadar wrote that for the first time, the phablet-sized iPhone 7 Plus was "markedly better" than the smaller model. He highlighted improved battery life and praised the camera, calling the Plus' dual cameras "excellent" for point-and-shoot, and "much improved" for low-light performance. McCann wrote that the lack of a headphone jack was "initially frustrating", but noted that it was a "positive step forward for the mobile industry", despite the "short-term effects ... making the most noise for now".[75]


Headphone jack controversy
--------------------------------------------------
Criticism of the iPhone 7 centered around the removal of the headphone jack, including the inability to use wired headphones with the included adapter and charge the device simultaneously.[d][77]

In a particularly scathing article, Nilay Patel of The Verge wrote that removing the headphone jack, "a deeply established standard" as he put it, would be "user-hostile and stupid". He goes on to list reasons why removing the port is negative, concluding with "No one is asking for this" and "Vote with your dollars".[78]

Gordon Kelly of Forbes noted that wireless audio technology was immature at the moment, with Bluetooth audio quality being inferior and Lightning's audio reliability still in question. The removal of the headphone jack meant that in Patel's words, "You're being pushed into an era where you will have to pay more for decent headphones due to their need for an integrated DAC and/or Lightning licensing", and pointed out that "the only company to profit from this situation is Apple, who will now be charging licensing fees to millions of headphone companies".[73]

In particular, Apple's vice president Phil Schiller, who announced the change, was mocked extensively online for stating that removing the headphone jack took 'courage'.[79][80] An online petition created by the consumer group SumOfUs, that accuses Apple of planned obsolescence and causing substantial electronic waste by removing the headphone jack,[81] reached over 300,000 signatures.[82]


Issues
--------------------------------------------------

Hissing noises
--------------------------------------------------
Some users have reported a strange hissing noise during heavy usage of the phone. CNET reports it as "faint buzzes and hums coming from the backside".[83] The Daily Telegraph speculates that the iPhone 7's new A10 Fusion processor is the source of the noise, linking to tweets that compare the phone's hissing sound to "hearing the fans spin up loudly whenever your Mac's CPU gets used to its actual potential."[84]


Performance differences
--------------------------------------------------
The Guardian reported in October 2016 that storage tests from Unbox Therapy and GSMArena showed that the 32 GB iPhone 7 is "significantly" slower than the 128 and 256 GB versions, measuring data write speeds of 341 MB/s on a 128 GB iPhone 7 model versus 42 MB/s on a 32 GB model.[85] October 2016 network tests by Cellular Insights showed that models A1660 and A1661 with Qualcomm modems had "a significant performance edge" over models A1778 and A1784 with Intel modems. Inspection of the modems also found that the Qualcomm version's ability to use Ultra HD Voice had been turned off, likely to "level the playing field between the Qualcomm, and Intel variants". The report concluded with the statement that "We are not sure what was the main reason behind Apple's decision to source two different modem suppliers for the newest iPhone".[86][87] Bloomberg reported in November 2016 that tests by researchers from Twin Prime and Cellular Insights had shown the two modems to perform similarly on some U.S. cellular networks despite one of the modems being technically capable of faster connectivity. Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller told the publication that "Every iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus meets or exceeds all of Apple's wireless performance standards, quality metrics, and reliability testing ... In all of our rigorous lab tests based on wireless industry standards, in thousands of hours of real-world field testing, and in extensive carrier partner testing, the data shows there is no discernible difference in the wireless performance of any of the models". Bloomberg quoted analysts and technology advisers who stated that "[Apple] don't want one version to get the reputation that it is better" and that "This may not impact the fanboys, but it may make other consumers think twice about buying an Apple phone, especially if they think they might be purchasing a sub-standard product".[88]


Perception of slogan in Cantonese-speaking regions
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 7's "This is 7" slogan has been misunderstood when translated to certain other languages.[89][90] The phone's slogan in Mainland China is "7, is here;" (Chinese: 7，在此; pinyin: 7, zài cǐ), while in Hong Kong, its slogan is, "This, is iPhone 7;" (Chinese: 這，就是iPhone 7; Jyutping: ze5, zau6 si6 iPhone 7).

In Cantonese, the local language of Hong Kong, the slogan could be mistakenly interpreted as "This is penis". "Tsat", (Chinese: 杘; Jyutping: cat6), is a common slang term for an erect penis, and "seven", (Chinese: 七; Jyutping: cat1), which varies only in tone, is often used as a euphemism.[citation needed]


Replacing the home button
--------------------------------------------------
In the iPhone 7, Apple added a software lock that prevents individuals from attempting to replace the home button on their own. Users are now required to go to an Apple Store to have repairs done, with "recalibration" of the button being necessary. This is a step further than Apple went with iPhone 5S, 6 and 6S, where only Touch ID functionality would get disabled but the "return-to-home" functionality still worked.[91][92]


Failure to connect to cellular service
--------------------------------------------------
Some iPhone 7 devices with the model numbers A1660, A1779 and A1780 suffer from a problem where they show a "No service" message even when cellular reception is available. Apple will repair those devices for free within four years of the first retail sale of the unit.[93]


Loop disease
--------------------------------------------------
Some iPhone 7 devices suffer from a problem that affects audio in the device. Users reported a grayed-out speaker button during calls, grayed-out voice memo icon, and occasional freezing of the device. A few users also complained that lightning EarPods failed to work with the device and that the Wi-Fi button would be grayed out after restarting the iPhone. On May 4, 2018, Apple acknowledged the issue through an internal memo. If an affected iPhone 7 was no longer covered by warranty, Apple said its service providers could request an exception for this particular issue. The exemptions abruptly ended in July 2018 when Apple deleted the internal document. Many customers have complained Apple has charged customers around $350 to fix the issue. Many customers complain the issue first appeared after a software update.


Sales
--------------------------------------------------
Apple has deliberately withheld pre-order sales numbers, citing that these are "no longer a representative metric for our investors and customers".[94] Without releasing specific numbers, T-Mobile US stated that the iPhone 7 had broken the carrier's all-time record for first-day pre-order sales. The following weekend, T-Mobile US stated that iPhone 7 was its biggest iPhone launch ever, being "up nearly 4x compared to the next most popular iPhone".[95]

On September 14, 2016, two days before the iPhone 7 went on sale, Apple announced that due to high demand, they had sold out of all "jet black" iPhone 7's, and all colors of the iPhone 7 Plus.[96] This caused issues for customers in the iPhone Upgrade Program, who were unable to reserve new phones.[97] After customer complaints and a class action lawsuit,[98] Apple made changes to ensure members of the program could get new phones as soon as possible.[99]

In May 2017, analytics research company Strategy Analytics announced that iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus were the best-selling smartphones worldwide during the first quarter of 2017, selling 21.5 million and 17.4 million units, respectively.[100][101]


US carrier trade-in deals
--------------------------------------------------
For the initial U.S. sales of the iPhone 7, all four major wireless carriers announced trade-in deals. Under the deals, the monthly installment plan cost of the iPhone 7 is negated by a monthly credit on consumers' bill, but consumers who cancel their service with the carrier or pay off the phone prior to the installment contract completion will not receive credits for the remaining months.[102] Jacob Kastrenakes of The Verge noted that the deals effectively constituted a return to two-year phone contracts, in which the deals "essentially lock you into that carrier for two years".[103]

In the wake of these deals, Verizon announced they had seen an increase in sales over the release of the previous year's iPhone 6S, AT&T said that sales had exceeded its expectations, and T-Mobile and Sprint announced "huge increases in sales", with T-Mobile seeing a demand roughly four times higher for the 7 than the 6.[104]


Reports about trimmed production
--------------------------------------------------
In December 2016, DigiTimes reported that Apple had reduced production of the iPhone 7 because of decreasing demand for the product after the initial surge of interest waned. A reason cited was consumers and suppliers turning their attention to next year's iPhone model.[105][106]

A new report from Nikkei at the end of December included details on sales and production of the iPhone 7. The report, "based on data from suppliers", stated that Apple would trim production of the iPhone 7 by 10% in the first quarter of 2017, following "sluggish" sales. Nikkei reported that Apple previously trimmed production of the iPhone 7 by 20% due to accumulated inventory of the previous model, but that the new models had "sold more sluggishly than expected". Additionally, the report notes that the "iPhone 7 Plus, which features two cameras on its back face, remains popular", but "a shortage of camera sensors has curbed Apple's ability to meet demand for the phones".[107]

List of iPhone models

The iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus are smartphones developed and marketed by Apple Inc. They are the eleventh generation of the iPhone. The iPhone 8 was released on September 22, 2017, succeeding the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, respectively.[9]

The designs of the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus are largely similar to that of their predecessors except for the addition of a glass back. The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus were the final flagship iPhone models to feature the home button and Touch ID. Notable changes include the removal of the rose gold and jet black color variants,[10] addition of inductive charging, a faster processor, and improved cameras and displays. The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus share most of their internal hardware with the iPhone X.

The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus were discontinued as of February 2020, having sold 86.3 million units worldwide, making them one of the best-selling smartphones of all time.[11][12][original research?] They initially shipped with iOS 11 and supported up to iOS 16, and do not support iOS 17.[13]

The second and third generations of the entry level iPhone SE retain the iPhone 8's exterior dimensions and Touch ID, with upgraded hardware.


History
--------------------------------------------------
Apple invited the press to a media event at the Steve Jobs Theater in the Apple Park campus on September 12, 2017.[14] The iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus were announced at that event, and released on September 22, 2017.[15]

On April 9, 2018, Apple introduced an iPhone 8 with a red color finish and a black front, in support of their partnership with Product Red and their AIDS fundraising campaign.[16]

In November 2018, just over a year from initial release, Apple started selling refurbished iPhone 8 models starting at $499.[17] The price was lowered to US$319.[18] Refurbished iPhone 8 Plus models were available starting at $599.[19] The price was also subsequently lowered to US$469 and later to $359.[20]

On April 15, 2020, Apple announced the second-generation iPhone SE and discontinued the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, which share the external form factor but has upgraded internals including an A13 Bionic processor.[21][22] On March 8, 2022, Apple announced the third-generation iPhone SE with the same exterior dimensions, but with an upgraded camera and Apple's A15 processor.


Specifications
--------------------------------------------------

Hardware
--------------------------------------------------

Display
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus retain the Retina HD Display found in the iPhone 7,[23] but they now feature True Tone technology, allowing for automatic screen adjustments based on surrounding ambient lighting.[15] They can play HDR10 and Dolby Vision content despite not having an HDR-ready display, done by down-converting the HDR content to fit the display while still having some enhancements to dynamic range, contrast, and wide color gamut compared to standard content.[24]


Camera
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus feature a 12 MP camera with autofocus, f/1.8 aperture and optical image stabilization capable of capturing 4K video at 24, 30, or 60 frames per second, or 1080p video at 30, 60, 120 or 240 frames per second,[25] and a Quad LED True Tone Flash with Slow Sync.[26] The Slow Sync flash, 4K 60fps, and 1080p 240 fps options are new features for the 8 and 8 Plus, over the options available on the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus.

The iPhone 8 Plus, like the iPhone 7 Plus, adds a second, telephoto, lens. A new AI-driven option is available for the iPhone 8 Plus, called Portrait Lighting--making use of the more capable image signal processor in the A11 SoC.[26]

Both models have a 7 MP front camera with an f/2.2 aperture capable of capturing 1080p video at 30 frames per second and 720p video at 24 frames per second, along with face detection and high-dynamic range.[25][27]

The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus record videos with single channel audio (mono).[28]

Still photos with 6.5 megapixels (3412×1920) can be captured during video recording.[29]


Chipset
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus contain the Apple A11 Bionic system-on-chip, a hexa-core processor that the company says features two performance cores that are 25% faster than those found in the iPhone 7's A10 processor and four efficiency cores that are 70% faster than those in the prior model. The phones also feature an Apple-designed graphics processing unit 30% faster than prior units, with the same level of performance as the A10 at half the power.[15]


Other
--------------------------------------------------
The phones have glass backs instead of the complete aluminum housing found on prior models, enabling the use of Qi inductive charging.[15] The phones are rated IP67 for water resistance and dust resistance. [30] Both models come with 64, 128, and 256 gigabytes storage options,[31][32] and are offered in silver, gold, or Space Gray color options.[15] A Product Red special edition version in red with a black front was released on April 9, 2018.[16] The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus were the last iPhones with white front in Silver and Gold colors.

In addition to Qi wireless charging, the iPhone 8 also supports wired charging using Apple's proprietary Lightning connector. It can fast-charge from a charger providing USB Power Delivery combined with a special USB-C to Lightning adapter cable supporting fast charging.[33]

The iPhone 8 has a 6 out of 10 reparability score from iFixit, mainly due to the use of excessive glue for the back glass.[34]


Software
--------------------------------------------------
Both the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus were supplied with iOS 11 on launch,[25][27] and support iOS 12, iOS 13, iOS 14, iOS 15 and iOS 16. Apple announced that the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, as well as the iPhone X, would not support iOS 17 due to hardware limitations.[35] However, the devices still receive security updates.


Reception
--------------------------------------------------
Reception of the phones was generally positive, with reviewers praising the addition of inductive charging, fast charge capability, and the new Apple A11 processor, while criticizing the aging design that was introduced with the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in 2014.

Samuel Axon of Ars Technica called the A11 processor "a marvelous feat of engineering", writing that it offers "industry-leading performance". Axon also praised the cameras, writing that "The colors are great, and low light performance is very good for a smartphone".[36] Chris Velazco of Engadget praised the speed of the A11 processor, the build quality and the "excellent" camera, while criticizing design familiarities with previous iPhone generations and limited water-protection levels compared to competitors.[37]

John McCann of TechRadar enjoyed the feel of the glass back despite criticizing the phone's overall design. McCann also praised the camera and called inductive charging a "useful" addition to the iPhone lineup.[38]

David Pierce of Wired similarly stated that the iPhone 8 models were overshadowed by the iPhone X, despite calling them "virtually perfect phones". Pierce praised performance, cameras, and displays, while repeatedly criticizing the "outdated" design.[39]

Nilay Patel of The Verge called the iPhone 8 the "default option", noting that the 8 models stand as almost universally overlooked by Apple's other new iPhone launched, the iPhone X. He nevertheless praised the device's form factor for being easy and non-slippery to hold and the display's addition of True Tone technology and upgraded speakers, though he cited issues with inductive charging speed through wireless pads as well as the price of the iPhone 8 Plus 256 GB, which was close to that of the iPhone X. Patel also criticized the iPhone 8's aging design, dating back to the iPhone 6 released in 2014; the most notable critique was of the thick bezels when compared to other 2017 smartphones, designed with nearly bezel-less faces to incorporate larger screens in a similar form factor.[40]

The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus were also criticized for their durability, as drop tests performed showed that the rear glass is not "the most durable glass ever in a smartphone", as claimed by Apple.[41][42]

Camera testing company DxOMark gave the camera on the iPhone 8 a rating of 92 and 8 Plus a rating of 94, giving them the title of best smartphone cameras tested by the company.[43][44] The Samsung Galaxy Note 8 later matched the iPhone 8 Plus with an identical overall score of 94.[45][46] They were later overtaken by the Google Pixel 2, which scored a 98 rating.[47]

Although being the first mobile phone to record 2160p at 60 frames per second, the iPhone 8, 8 Plus and X have been criticized in a review by GSMArena for its mono (single-channel) audio recording for videos, while stereo audio recording for videos has been available on competing mobile phone models for several years, such as the Samsung Galaxy S3 and Sony Xperia S from 2012.[28][48][49]


Issues
--------------------------------------------------
On August 31, 2018, Apple announced that a "very small percentage" of iPhone 8 devices released between September 2017 and March 2018 contained a manufacturing defect in the logic board. This fault affected iPhone 8 models sold in Australia, China, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Macau, New Zealand, and the United States. Defective devices may experience unexpected reboots, a frozen or unresponsive screen, or may fail to turn on. Users with an affected device, as determined by their serial number, can have their device replaced for free by Apple. This issue does not affect the iPhone 8 Plus.[50][51]

List of iPhone models

The iPhone 11 is a smartphone developed and marketed by Apple Inc. It is the thirteenth generation of iPhone, succeeding the iPhone XR, and was unveiled on September 10, 2019, alongside the higher-end iPhone 11 Pro at the Steve Jobs Theater in Apple Park, Cupertino, by Apple CEO Tim Cook. Preorders began on September 13, 2019, and the phone was officially released on September 20, 2019, one day after the official public release of iOS 13.

Despite minimal exterior changes from the preceding iPhone XR, substantial design changes within the phone took place, including the addition of the more powerful Apple A13 Bionic chip as well as an ultra-wide dual-camera system.[9] In October 2020, Apple halted the inclusion of both Apple EarPods and the wall adapter, citing environmental goals.[10][11]

As of March 2022[update], the iPhone 11 has sold 159.2 million units worldwide, making it the tenth best-selling smartphone of all time.[12][13]

The iPhone 11 as well as the iPhone 12 mini and iPhone 13 Pro with its Max variant were discontinued and removed from Apple's website after the announcement of the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro on September 7, 2022.


History
--------------------------------------------------
Details regarding the smartphone were widely leaked before the official release; complete specifications and renderings of the phone were widely publicized. Among the most significant changes were improvements in the cameras and the continuation of the 'notch' design around the frontal camera which dipped down into the screen, a feature started by the iPhone X.[14][15][16] The official event invite which was sent out to developers contained a graphic featuring an Apple logo made of layered colored glass, implied to be the new colors for the phone. A patent filed by Apple earlier in the year also hinted at a new camera design.[17][18]


Design
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 11 was available in six colors: Purple, Yellow, Green, Black, White and Product (Red). The top of the screen retains the 'notch' design, wherein the TrueDepth camera system and phone speaker are encapsulated in a black, rounded-out rectangle that dips into the screen, similar to its predecessor, the iPhone XR. An elevated area in the top corner on the back of the iPhone acts as a camera housing, containing the microphone, the flashlight, and both of the rear-facing digital cameras.[11][19] The Apple logo on the back of the phone is centered to be equidistant to all edges and is made of a reflective material.


Specifications
--------------------------------------------------

Hardware
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 11, along with the iPhone 11 Pro, uses Apple's A13 Bionic processor, which contains a third-generation neural engine. It has three internal storage options: 64 GB, 128 GB, and 256 GB.[20] It also has 4 GB of RAM.[21] The iPhone 11 has an IP68 water- and dust-resistant rating along with dirt and grime, and is water-resistant up to 2 m (6.6 ft) for 30 minutes. However, the manufacturer's warranty does not cover liquid damage to the phone. Also, like previous iPhones, both phones do not have a headphone jack, and initially came with wired EarPods with a Lightning connector, although Apple no longer includes these with any device.[11][21] The iPhone 11 is the first smartphone with built-in ultra wideband hardware, via its Apple U1 chip.[22][23][24]


Display
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 11 has a 6.1-inch (15 cm) IPS LCD with a resolution of 1792 × 828 pixels (1.4 megapixels) at a pixel density of 326 PPI with a maximum brightness of 625 nits and a 1400:1 contrast ratio and it is equivalent to the iPhone XR. It supports Dolby Vision, HDR10, True-Tone, and a wide color gamut. As with the iPhone 11 Pro, XR, XS, and X, the display has a notch at the top for the TrueDepth camera system and the speaker. The display has an oleophobic coating, making it fingerprint-resistant.[2][21] Apple announced in September 2019 that both the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro would show a warning notification if a display were replaced with an unauthorized part. Apple stated that problems with the phone could arise if the wrong parts or procedures were used during the repair process.[25]


Battery
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 11 is supplied with a 11.91 Wh (3,110 mAh) battery, a slight increase from the 11.21 Wh (2,942 mAh) found in the iPhone XR. The battery is not user-replaceable.


Camera
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 11 includes a dual-lens 12 MP rear camera array. It has one ƒ/2.4 ultra-wide-angle lens with a 120° field of view and 2× optical zoom out, and one ƒ/1.8 wide-angle lens. The iPhone 11 supports 4K video at up to 60 fps and 1080p slow motion at up to 240 fps.[2] The phone also features an audio zoom feature, which focuses audio on the area on which is being zoomed in, similar to the Pro model.[21] Both of the cameras support video, although only the primary lens has OIS. It supports portrait mode with six portrait lighting effects, depth control, and an advanced bokeh effect. The phone also has an automatic night mode allowing the camera to take brighter pictures with reduced noise in low-light environments. Also, a redesigned camera app adds new features such as a scroll wheel for choosing between the different lenses and a feature called "QuickTake", which allows the user to long-press the shutter button to take a video. Apple has also announced a new Deep Fusion feature that takes advantage of AI and machine learning for image processing and was released via iOS 13.2 software update on October 29, 2019.[2][21][26]


Software
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 11 was supplied with iOS 13,[27] which includes Siri, Face ID (through the TrueDepth camera), Apple Pay, and Apple Card support. It received iOS 14 on September 16, 2020, iOS 15 on September 20, 2021, iOS 16 on September 12, 2022, iOS 17 on September 18, 2023.[28] and iOS 18 on September 16, 2024.[29]


Reception
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 11 drew generally positive reviews after its launch.[27][30] Reviews generally praised the phone's performance, battery life, and cameras, while criticizing the display as passable, but aging quickly. Reviewers also criticized the notch as being far too large for 2019. According to Counterpoint Research's Market Pulse, it was the second best-selling and the most popular model globally for 2019, in less than four months of launch.[31]


Controversy
--------------------------------------------------

Removal of the power adapter and EarPods
--------------------------------------------------
Apple, through an environmental initiative, has removed the EarPods and power adapter from new iPhone boxes starting October 2020, including the iPhone 11. Removing these items is claimed to reduce e-waste and permit a smaller iPhone box, allowing more devices to be transported simultaneously to decrease carbon footprint. However, Apple now includes a USB-C to Lightning cable, incompatible with the existing USB-A power adapters that Apple previously supplied with their devices. Upgraders can still use their existing iPhone power adapters and cables, but users wanting fast charging capabilities will have to purchase a USB-C power adapter separately.[32]

List of iPhone models

The iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Mini (stylized and marketed as iPhone 12 mini) are smartphones developed and marketed by Apple Inc. They are the fourteenth-generation iPhones, succeeding the iPhone 11.[19] They were unveiled at a virtually held Apple Special Event at Apple Park in Cupertino, California, on October 13, 2020, alongside the "premium flagship" iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max and HomePod Mini. Pre-orders for the iPhone 12 started on October 16, 2020, and the phone was released in most countries on October 23, 2020, alongside the iPhone 12 Pro and fourth-generation iPad Air. Pre-orders for the iPhone 12 Mini began on November 6, 2020, and the phone was released on November 13, 2020, alongside the iPhone 12 Pro Max.[20]

The major upgrades over the iPhone 11[21] include the addition of a Super Retina XDR OLED as opposed to the Liquid Retina LED-backlit LCD IPS panel on the iPhone 11 and XR, 5G support, the introduction of MagSafe, Apple A14 Bionic system on a chip (SoC) and high-dynamic-range video Dolby Vision 4K up to 30 fps.[22] The iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Mini, like the iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max, are the first iPhone models from Apple to no longer include a power adapter or EarPods headphones found in prior iPhone models; however, a USB-C to Lightning cable is included; this change was retroactively applied to other iPhone models sold by Apple, such as the iPhone XR, iPhone 11 and the second-generation iPhone SE.


Design
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 12 and 12 Mini is the first major redesign since the iPhone X. It features a chassis with flat edges, similar to the iPhone 4 and iPhone 5 designs, as well as the iPad Pro since 2018, and the 4th-generation iPad Air, which was also released in 2020. The notch size is similar to previous iPhone models, despite speculation about a reduction in width.[23] The borders around the display are thinner by 35% than any previous model. The new design also comes with a ceramic-hardened front glass, marketed as Ceramic Shield, while the back retains the previous generation Dual-Ion Exchange strengthened glass.[24]

On April 20, 2021, at Apple's Special Event “Spring Loaded”, Apple revealed a new purple color option which became available on April 30, 2021.[25]

The iPhone 12 and 12 Mini are available in six colors: Black, White, Product Red, Green, Blue, and Purple.[24]


Specifications
--------------------------------------------------

Hardware
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Mini use Apple's six-core A14 Bionic processor, which contains a next-generation neural engine. They both have three internal storage options: 64, 128, and 256 GB.[a] Both also carry an IP68 water and dust resistance rating along with dirt and grime, and is water-resistant up to six meters (20 feet) for 30 minutes. However, the manufacturer warranty does not cover liquid damage to the phone.

The iPhone 12 series are the first iPhone models to be supplied from launch without EarPods or a wall adapter, which Apple says was done to reduce carbon emissions and waste since most users already own them. Apple also claims 70% more boxes can fit on a pallet given the smaller box, and thus further reducing emissions.[26] A USB-C to Lightning cord is still included. This change also applies retroactively to all other iPhone models still in production.[27] To comply with French law regarding wireless device radiation and health which requires phones to be bundled with and promote use of hands-free accessories by children under 14, iPhone models will still include EarPods in this market.[28]

A magnetic connector known as MagSafe is introduced on the iPhone 12 models, allowing accessories such as cases and charging cords to be attached to the rear of the device. Accessories can also be stacked together.[29]

The devices support 5G cellular communications. This allows upload speeds of up to 200 Mbit/s and download speeds of up to 4 Gbit/s.[30] However, only models sold in the U.S. support the fastest mmWave technology; those sold elsewhere in the world, including Canada, support only sub-6 GHz frequency bands.[31] A new feature called Smart Data Mode enables 5G only when necessary to preserve battery life.[32]


Displays
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 12 features a 6.1-inch (155 mm) display[33] with Super Retina XDR OLED technology at a resolution of 2532 × 1170 pixels and a pixel density of about 460 ppi.[34] The iPhone 12 Mini features a 5.4-inch (137 mm) display with the same technology at a resolution of 2340 × 1080 pixels, and a pixel density of about 476 ppi. Both phones have a peak brightness of 1200 nits when viewing HDR content equivalent to the iPhone 12 Pro, and normal brightness of 625 nits.[34] Both phones also use an improved glass-ceramic covering called Ceramic Shield which is co-developed with Corning Inc. Apple describes it as having "4 times better drop performance" and being "tougher than any smartphone glass".[35]


Batteries
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 12 has a 10.78 Wh (2,815 mAh) battery, a slight decrease from the 11.91 Wh (3,110 mAh) battery found in the iPhone 11 and identical to the battery found in the iPhone 12 Pro. The iPhone 12 Mini has a 8.57 Wh (2,227 mAh) battery. Like previous iPhones, the battery is not user-replaceable.[36]


Chipsets
--------------------------------------------------
Both the iPhone 12 and 12 Mini have the Apple A14 Bionic, the first ARM-based smartphone system-on-a-chip (SoC) manufactured on the 5 nm process node. However, unlike previous years, they are not the first Apple devices to receive the newest A-series processor, with the fourth-generation iPad Air being the first. Both phones use Qualcomm's Snapdragon X55 5G modem.


Cameras
--------------------------------------------------
Both phones have two rear 12-megapixel cameras: wide and ultra-wide. The wide camera is a 26 mm full-frame equivalent with an f/1.6 aperture which captures 27% more light than the f/1.8 aperture in the iPhone 11[20] and a seven-element lens. The ultra-wide camera is a 13 mm full-frame equivalent with an f/2.4 aperture and a five-element lens.[37]

All cameras now support Night Mode for both photo and time-lapse video at full resolution.[24] Smart HDR has been improved thanks to Smart HDR 3.[37] This iPhone model is the first capable of shooting 10-bit high dynamic range Dolby Vision 4K video at up to 30 fps which allows for greater brightness and deeper shadows.[38]

The front-facing, TrueDepth camera features a 12-megapixel camera with an f/2.2 aperture. This model also added Night Mode to the front-facing camera.[24]

Sensors

The iPhone 12 and 12 Mini include mostly the same sensors found on prior iPhone models going back to the iPhone X. These include an accelerometer, gyroscope, barometer, proximity sensor, ambient light sensor, and a digital compass. The devices also include the Face ID sensor for biometric authentication.


Software
--------------------------------------------------
Both phones originally shipped with iOS 14.[24] The devices come with the stock iOS apps, such as Safari, Weather, and Messages, and they include Siri, the personal assistant in iOS. They received iOS 15 on September 20, 2021, iOS 16 on September 12, 2022, iOS 17 on September 18, 2023, and most recently, iOS 18 on September 16, 2024.[39]


Reception
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 12 received largely positive reviews. The Verge called it a "beautiful, powerful, and incredibly capable device", praising the new design reminiscent of the iPhone 5, the speed of the A14 Bionic processor, its 5G capabilities, addition of the OLED display like on the high end iPhones, combined with much slimmer bezels than previous iPhone models and improved battery life over iPhone 11.[40] Engadget also gave the iPhone 12 a positive review, praising the MagSafe wireless charging and accessories magnetic attachment as well as the redesigned camera system, a greatly improved display like in its Pro counterparts.[41]

iPhone 12 was the third best-selling and was the most popular model globally in Q2 2021.[42]

Apple was criticized for the continued reliance on Face ID as the sole biometric option to unlock the device, which is incompatible with face masks. iOS 14.5 allowed the use of a paired Apple Watch to unlock the phone while wearing a mask, while iOS 15.4 allows unlocking with a mask on, without an Apple Watch. The third-generation iPhone SE is the only iPhone currently produced by Apple that supports Touch ID, an alternative unlocking option that is compatible with face masks. All models can still use a passcode to log in.[43][44][45][46]

The iPhone 12 mini has received more mixed reviews. Some praised the phone for being a new small phone, while others criticized the price and inferior battery life compared to the full-size 12[47] (although the battery life of the iPhone 12 mini is longer than that of the second-generation iPhone SE[48]).


"OLED-gate"
--------------------------------------------------
Within two weeks after its public release, a thread was started at Apple Support Communities describing a problem with the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro OLED panel black pixels not shutting off completely in black scenes, resulting in what was described as "ugly glowing".[49] A considerable number of users have since posted replies reporting the same problem, photos and videos have been shared online demonstrating the issue. As of January 2021, Apple has not yet made an official statement.


EarPods and power adapter controversy
--------------------------------------------------
Apple no longer includes either EarPods or a power adapter in the boxes of all iPhone 12 and 12 Pro models, claiming that it is an environmental initiative and no longer including them would reduce e-waste and permit smaller iPhone boxes, allowing more devices to be transported simultaneously to decrease its carbon footprint. The boxes only include a USB-C to Lightning cable, incompatible with the existing USB-A power adapters that Apple previously supplied with its devices. Users can still use their existing USB-A power adapters and cables but must purchase a USB-C power adapter sold separately to enable fast charging.

The iPhone 12 was sold in France with EarPods as the law required that smartphones be bundled with “hands-free kits” or a “headset” in order to protect children aged 14 and younger from electromagnetic radiation.[50][51]

In December 2020, a Brazilian consumer rights watchdog Procon-SP Foundation requested Apple to provide proof that not including chargers is beneficial to the environment. The watchdog argues that Apple removing the charger is harming consumers and wants to force the company to include one as it claims the charger is an essential component.[52]

The Verge reported the reason power adapters and EarPods are no longer included could be to offset the increased cost of 5G components. These new components are reported to cost 30% more than their predecessors.[53]


Repairability concerns
--------------------------------------------------
iFixit and Australian YouTuber Hugh Jeffreys discovered that a number of key components such as the cameras would malfunction or display warnings if they are replaced with new ones or those taken from an otherwise identical donor unit.[54] Internal Apple documents also mention that, beginning with the iPhone 12 and in subsequent models, authorized technicians would have to run the phones through an internal System Configuration tool to reprogram repaired units in order to account for hardware changes. While Apple has yet to comment on the issue, the inability to replace key system components have raised concerns about right to repair and planned obsolescence.[55] However, the iPhone 12 Mini does not have this issue.[56] Apple later addressed the issue with the release of iOS 14.4, which displays a warning message if the phone detects an unpaired camera module but otherwise allows for full functionality.[57]


Electromagnetic radiation concerns
--------------------------------------------------
In September 2023, the French watchdog agency Agence nationale des fréquences [fr] notified Apple that sales of the iPhone 12 must be halted in France due to the device exceeding the legal specific absorption rate for consumer electronics. The agency also requested that Apple must recall all iPhone 12s that have been produced in order to meet safety regulations. However, this coincided with the release of the iPhone 15 models where Apple also discontinued the iPhone 12 globally.[58]

Despite the move however, France's digital minister did emphasize the iPhone 12's radiation levels[59] remained well below the threshold deemed harmful by scientific studies. Even Apple, "...disputed the findings and said the device complies with regulations..." [Regulations | source 39]. This highlighted a discrepancy between the agency's tests and real-world phone usage scenarios.[60]

List of iPhone models

The iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus are smartphones developed and marketed by Apple. They are the eighteenth-generation iPhones, succeeding the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus, and those phones succeed the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus. The devices were unveiled alongside the higher-priced iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max during the September 9, 2024 Apple Event at Apple Park in Cupertino, California.[3] These lower-end phones come with the software update iOS 18, with more updates to come later in the future.


History
--------------------------------------------------
When Apple announced in "It's Glowtime" Event, The SiP chip of the lower-priced iPhone 16 lineup have skipped from the Apple A17 Pro (used in the iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max and iPad Mini 7th generation) to the regular Apple A18 (a low-entry variant 5-core GPU successor to the Apple A16 Bionic used in the iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 14 Pro Max, iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus) which this SiP is the first Apple A-series SiP in the iPhone to come with the two variants including the low-entry Apple A18 (a 5-core GPU variant, used in the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus) and the high-end Apple A18 Pro (a 6-core GPU variant, used in the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max).

The devices were unveiled during an event on September 9, 2024, marking the first time an iPhone release had been announced on a Monday.[4] It is also the first iPhone to not come included with Apple stickers, as Apple removed it for "environmental reasons", but the stickers can be included if a customer asks for it at an Apple Store.[5]


Design
--------------------------------------------------
Like the iPhone 15, the device features rounded edges, a slightly curved display, and back glass.


Display
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus retain their screen sizes of 6.1 inches and 6.7 inches, respectively. They feature a full-edge screen design with slim borders.


Camera
--------------------------------------------------
iPhone 16 features a more refined dual-lens array on the back, with a 48 megapixel Fusion wide-angle lens and 12 megapixel ultra-wide lens. The cameras are now aligned vertically, similar to iPhone 12, instead of diagonally like on iPhone 15, enabling spatial video capture.

There is also an improved Photographic Styles feature for real-time lighting and color adjustments, allowing specific tones and colors to be manipulated. [6]


Colors
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 16 and 16 Plus come in five colors: ultramarine, teal, pink, white and black.[7]


Hardware
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 16 and the iPhone 16 Plus use an Apple A18 system on a chip. The chip is optimized for running Generative artificial intelligence and features a Neural Engine that is twice as fast as its predecessor.

The iPhone 16 includes an updated 48-megapixel Fusion camera, the same resolution as the iPhone 15, with 2 μm, quad pixel PDAF, sensor-shift OIS, 100% Focus Pixels, support for super-high-resolution photos (24MP and 48MP). It has a new ultrawide camera with a wider aperture, automatic focus and 1.4 μm, 100% Focus Pixels.[8]

All ‌iPhone 16‌ models have an improved thermal design. The main logic board has been updated, centralizing chip placement and optimizing the surrounding architecture. The recycled aluminum substructure dissipates heat for up to 30 percent higher sustained performance for gaming.[9]

Every model in the iPhone 16 lineup has support for WiFi 7.[10]


Action Button
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus come with the Action Button, first featured on the iPhone 15 Pro lineup. By default, the Action Button toggles silent mode. However, users can change the button's feature to do different things other than silent mode, like open the Camera app or toggle a focus mode.


Camera Control button
--------------------------------------------------
All iPhone 16 models now come with a new button called Camera Control. This button is on the right side of the device, and allows the user to open the camera app, switch between different camera controls and features, and taking photos and videos. The button can distinguish between light and hard presses. By pressing the button once, it opens the camera app. By lightly pressing it twice, it opens a small menu with different camera controls, such as zoom or tone. Pressing the button hard once takes a photo, while holding for a few seconds starts a video. [11]


Battery and charging
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 16 has been upgraded in terms of battery capacity.[12]

The base iPhone 16 has video playback duration of up to 22 hours, while the iPhone 16 Plus has video playback up to 27 hours. The iPhone 16 has duration of audio playback up to 80 hours, 20% less than the iPhone 16 Plus with 100 hours of audio playback. The MagSafe wireless charging standard has been refreshed with a longer cable as an option, allowing the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus to charge at a faster speed of 25W with a 30W power adapter.


Enclosure
--------------------------------------------------
The enclosure is made up of 85% recycled content.[8]


Software
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 16 launched with iOS 18. While the device was announced alongside Apple Intelligence, these features were delayed until after release.[13]

iOS 18 includes RecoveryOS on the iPhone 16 series that allows users to recover and restore firmware wirelessly using another iPhone.[14]


Specifications
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 16 and 16 Plus have a vertical camera layout, similar to the iPhone 12, as opposed to the diagonal layout for iPhone 13, iPhone 14, and iPhone 15. USB Type-C port is used, albeit with USB 2.0 data transfer speeds up to 480 Mb/s.[15]


Price
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 16 has a starting price of US$799, while the iPhone 16 Plus starts at US$899. Pre-orders began on September 13, 2024, and sales started September 20.[16]


Criticism
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 16 has received positive feedback for several aspects, but also shows a few limitations. The upgraded design is a favourite, bringing a refreshed aesthetic with the available vibrant colour options, which feel more dynamic than past models. The display maintains Apple’ Super Retina HDR quality, but is limited to a 60Hz refresh rate, which some users find outdated compared to faster displays on cheaper competitor phones.[17][18]

The Apple Watch is a brand of smartwatch products developed and marketed by Apple. It incorporates fitness tracking, health-oriented capabilities, and wireless telecommunication, and integrates with watchOS and other Apple products and services. The Apple Watch was released in April 2015,[5][6] and quickly became the world's best-selling wearable device: 4.2 million were sold in the second quarter of fiscal 2015,[7] and more than 115 million people were estimated to use an Apple Watch as of December 2022.[8] Apple has introduced a new generation of the Apple Watch with improved internal components each September[9] – each labeled by Apple as a 'Series', with certain exceptions.[a]

Each Series has been initially sold in multiple variants defined by the watch casing's material, color, and size (except for the budget watches Series 1 and SE, available only in aluminum,[10][13] and the Ultra, available only in 49 mm titanium[12]), and beginning with Series 3, by the option in the aluminum variants for LTE cellular connectivity, which comes standard with the other materials.[14] The band included with the watch can be selected from multiple options from Apple, and watch variants in aluminum co-branded with Nike and in stainless steel co-branded with Hermès are also offered, which include exclusive bands, colors, and digital watch faces carrying those companies' branding.[14]

The Apple Watch operates in conjunction with the user's iPhone for functions such as configuring the watch and syncing data with iPhone apps, but can separately connect to a Wi-Fi network for data-reliant purposes, including communications, app use, and audio streaming.[15][16] LTE-equipped models can also perform these functions over a mobile network, and can make and receive phone calls independently when the paired iPhone is not nearby or is powered off.[b] The oldest iPhone model that is compatible with any given Apple Watch depends on the version of the operating system installed on each device.[19] As of September 2024[update], new Apple Watches come with watchOS 11 preinstalled and require an iPhone running iOS 18, which is compatible for the iPhone XR, iPhone XS and later.[20]


Development
--------------------------------------------------
Apple design chief Jony Ive became interested in building a watch shortly after Steve Jobs's death in October 2011.[21] That December, The New York Times reported that Apple was exploring various ideas, including a "curved-glass iPod that would wrap around the wrist", which users would interact with through the Siri voice assistant, and which "could relay information back to the iPhone".[22] In February 2013, the NYT and The Wall Street Journal again confirmed that Apple was working on a smartwatch with a curved display,[23] and Bloomberg News said the team had grown to about 100 designers.[24]

In March 2013, Apple hired ex-Adobe chief technology officer Kevin Lynch, reporting to Bob Mansfield,[25] to lead the watch project, which would become the company's first major new product without input from late co-founder Steve Jobs.[21] Apple started the project without specific use cases in mind, not knowing what problems the watch would solve, but felt that "technology was going to move onto the body", according to Alan Dye, who was in charge of its user interface. According to Kevin Lynch, the team felt people spent too much time on their phone, nagged by notifications, and a watch would provide "that level of engagement [...] in a way that's a little more human, a little more at the moment when you're with somebody".[21]

In July 2013, Financial Times reported that Apple had begun hiring more employees to work on the smartwatch, and that it was targeting a retail release in late 2014.[26]

The software evolved more quickly than the hardware. To test it, the team created its first prototype, an iPhone strapped to the wrist with Velcro, which showed the Apple watch software in its true size and an onscreen watch crown for input. The crown was later turned into a physical dongle plugged into the headphone jack. Early on, the user interface and bundled apps were inspired by the iPhone, but they were too complex and underwent three rounds of redesigns, to avoid awkwardly long interactions that would annoy users. The team worked on notification vibrations and sounds for more than a year, attempting to make them reflect the nature of different notifications. They also added a way to show a contextual menu by pressing the display more deeply, called Force Touch. In contrast with Apple's usually narrow design options, the team thought a watch would need to appeal to users' diverse tastes in fashion, so they opted to give a choice of bands, models (like the gold-plated Apple Watch Edition) and watch faces.[21]


Unveiling and release
--------------------------------------------------
In April 2014, Apple CEO Tim Cook told The Wall Street Journal that the company was planning to launch new products that year, but revealed no specifics.[27]

In June 2014, Reuters reported that production of a smartwatch product was expected to begin in July for an October release.[28]

During a September 2014 press event where the iPhone 6 was also presented, the new watch product was introduced by Tim Cook's "one more thing" section. After a video focusing on the design process, Cook reappeared on stage wearing an Apple Watch.[29]

In comparison to other Apple products and competing smartwatches, marketing of the Apple Watch promoted the device as a fashion accessory.[30] Apple later focused on its health and fitness-oriented features, in an effort to compete with dedicated activity trackers. The watchOS 3 added fitness tracking for wheelchair users, social sharing in the Activity app, and a Breathe app to facilitate mindfulness.[31]

The device was not branded as "iWatch", which would have put it in line with its product lines such as iPod, iPhone, and iPad. In the United States, the "iWatch" trademark is owned by OMG Electronics – who was crowdfunding a device under the same name; it is owned in the European Union by Irish firm Probendi.[32] In July 2015, Probendi sued Apple Inc. for trademark infringement, arguing that through keyword advertising on the Google search engine, it caused advertising for the Apple Watch to appear on search results pages when users searched for the trademarked term "iWatch".[33]


Release
--------------------------------------------------
Pre-orders for the Apple Watch began on April 10, 2015, with the official release on April 24.[34] Initially, it was not available at the Apple Store; customers could make appointments for demonstrations and fitting, but the device was not in-stock for walk-in purchases and had to be reserved and ordered online. CNET felt that this distribution model was designed to prevent Apple Store locations from having long lineups due to the high demand.[35][36] The first ever retail store to display the Apple Watch to the public was Colette in Paris.[37] Later on, selected models were available in limited quantities at luxury boutiques and authorized resellers.[38]

On June 4, 2015, Apple announced that it planned to stock Apple Watch models at its retail locations.[36]

On August 24, 2015, Best Buy announced that it would begin stocking Apple Watch at its retail stores by the end of September.[39] Both T-Mobile US and Sprint also announced plans to offer Apple Watch through their retail stores.[40]

In September 2015, Apple launched a new subset of Apple Watch, with a stainless steel body and leather band, in collaboration with Hermès.[41] The following year, Apple launched another subset of Apple Watches in collaboration with Nike dubbed "Apple Watch Nike+". Both subsets featured cosmetic customization, but otherwise functioned like standard Apple Watches.[42]

Apple Watch went on sale in India in November 2015.[43] The device also launched in Chile, the Philippines, Indonesia, and South Africa.[44]


Hardware
--------------------------------------------------

Design and materials
--------------------------------------------------
Each series of Apple Watch is offered in multiple variants, distinguished by the casing's material, color, and size,[45] with special bands and digital watch faces available for certain variants co-branded with Nike and Hermès, which are also sometimes accompanied by other unique extras, like stainless steel charging pucks, premium packaging, and exclusive color basic bands.[46]

Originally at launch, the Apple Watch was marketed as one of three "collections", designating the case material. In order of increasing cost, the collections were:

Starting with Series 1/Series 2, Apple dropped the "Sport" moniker from the branding (apart from the sport bands), and the Apple Watch was available with either an aluminum (lowest cost) or stainless steel case. "Apple Watch Edition" branding still exists, but now refers to watch casings made from ceramic or titanium.[47]

Apple did not explicitly market the first-generation Apple Watch as being waterproof, stating that it can withstand splashes of water (such as rain and hand washing), but does not recommend submersion (IPX7). Apple introduced a higher level of water resistance with the release of the Apple Watch Series 2, and the device was explicitly advertised as being suitable for swimming and surfing.[48] The Series 7 also includes an IP6X certification for dust resistance.


Size
--------------------------------------------------
Since the introduction of the Apple Watch, it has been available in two sizes, primarily affecting screen resolution and area. The smaller size at launch was 38 mm (1.5 in), referring to the approximate height of the watch case; the larger size was 42 mm (1.7 in). Starting with Series 4, the two nominal sizes changed to 40 and 44 mm (1.6 and 1.7 in).[49] The nominal sizes changed again with the introduction of Series 7: 41 and 45 mm (1.6 and 1.8 in).

The overall shape and width of the watch has not changed significantly since its release, so customizable bands and accessories are typically compatible with any Apple Watch of the same size class. Bands that fit the smaller size class (38, 40, and 41 mm (1.5, 1.6, and 1.6 in) watches) and larger size class (42, 44, and 45 mm (1.7, 1.7, and 1.8 in) watches) are generally interchangeable within the class.[50] The casing of the watch includes a mechanism to allow the user to change the straps without special tools.


Input and sensors
--------------------------------------------------
For input, the Watch features a "digital crown" on one side which can be turned to scroll or zoom content on screen, and pressed to return to the home screen or display recently used apps. Next to the crown (on the same side of the watch) is the Side Button, which can be used to access Control Center and the contactless payment service Apple Pay.[51] The Watch also prominently features a touchscreen; prior to Series 6/SE, the screen included Force Touch technology, which enabled the display to become pressure-sensitive and therefore capable of distinguishing between a tap and a press for displaying contextual menus.[52] Force Touch has since been physically removed in Watch Series 6 and Watch SE,[53] and has been disabled via software on Watch Series 5 and earlier on models supporting watchOS 7.[54]

Additional sensors integrated into the Watch include an accelerometer, gyroscope, and barometer, which are used to determine device orientation, user movement, and altitude.[55] The back of all Apple Watches are equipped with a Heart Rate Monitor, which projects infrared and green light from light-emitting diodes (LEDs) onto the user's skin and photodiodes measure the varying amount of light reflected. Because blood absorbs green light and reflects red light, the amounts of each type of reflected light are compared to determine heart rate. The Watch adjusts the sampling rate and LED brightness as needed.[55] Starting with the Series 4, Apple added electrical sensors to the Digital Crown and back, allowing the Watch to take electrocardiogram (ECG) readings;[56] the device won FDA clearance in October 2018, becoming the first consumer device capable of taking an ECG.[57] A blood oxygen monitor was added with the Series 6 in 2020, albeit as a "wellness" device not capable of diagnosing a medical condition.[58] The blood oxygen monitor added red LEDs to the back, allowing the watch to determine oxygen levels by measuring blood color.[59] The Watch SE reverted to the capabilities of the Series 3, dropping the electrical sensors and blood oxygen monitor.[60]


Battery
--------------------------------------------------
Apple rates the device's battery for 18 hours of mixed usage.[52][61] Apple Watch is charged by means of inductive charging.[5] If the watch's battery depletes to less than 10 percent, the user is alerted and offered to enable Low Power Mode, which allows the user to continually use the watch while some features are disabled. The watch then reverts to its original mode when the battery is sufficiently charged.[62]


Bands
--------------------------------------------------
Apple Watch comes with an included band (strap) to attach it to the user's wrist. The proprietary band attachment mechanism allows swapping models by holding down the connectors on the bottom of the watch and sliding the band pieces out.[63] Apple produces bands in a variety of materials and colors; however, third-party bands are still compatible when using Apple's design guidelines.[64] Bands designed for the original Series 1–3 38 mm and 42 mm case sizes are compatible with the Series 4–6 40 mm and 44 mm cases, as well as the Series 7 41 mm and 45 mm cases, respectively.[65]

Starting with Apple Watch Series 5, Apple introduced the online Apple Watch Studio which allows customers to mix and match bands on purchase, eliminating the need to purchase a specific combination of case and band design, and allows for a simplification of packaging (since Apple Watch Series 4 in 2018).[66]


Models
--------------------------------------------------
Apple Watch models have been divided into five "collections": Apple Watch (1st generation-present), Apple Watch Sport (1st generation), Apple Watch Nike+ (Series 2-present), Apple Watch Hermès (1st generation-Series 5, Series 6-present), and Apple Watch Edition (1st generation only).[citation needed] They are differentiated by combinations of cases, bands, and exclusive watch faces; Apple Watch comes with either aluminum or stainless steel cases, and various watch bands (only stainless steel was offered for Apple Watch 1st generation); Apple Watch Sport came with aluminum cases and sport bands or woven nylon bands; Apple Watch Nike+ comes with aluminum cases and Nike sport bands or sport loops; Apple Watch Hermès uses stainless steel cases and Hermès leather watch bands (also included is an exclusive Hermès orange sport band); and Apple Watch Edition came with ceramic cases and various bands (the Apple Watch Edition used 18 karat yellow or rose gold).[67] With the Series 5, the Edition tier was expanded with a new titanium case.

Apple Watch Series 1 models were previously only available with aluminum cases and sport bands.[68]

As of Series 3, each Apple Watch model in aluminum, the least expensive casing, is available either with or without LTE cellular connectivity, while the models with the other casing materials available (stainless steel and sometimes ceramic and titanium) always include it.[17][69]

Each model through Series 3 comes in a 38mm or 42mm size options, with the larger size having a slightly larger screen and battery.[52] The Series 4 was updated to 40mm and 44mm models, respectively. The Series 7 has been updated to 41mm and 45mm models. The Series 10 has been updated to 42mm and 46mm models. Each model has various color and band options. Featured Apple-made bands include colored sport bands, sport loop, woven nylon band, classic buckle, modern buckle, leather loop, Milanese loop, and a link bracelet.[52]


First generation
--------------------------------------------------
The 1st generation Apple Watch (colloquially referred to as Series 0) uses the single-core S1 system-on-chip. It does not have a built-in GPS chip, instead relying on a paired iPhone for location services. It features a new linear actuator hardware from Apple called the "Taptic Engine", providing realistic haptic feedback when an alert or a notification is received, and is used for other purposes by certain apps.[52] The watch is equipped with a built-in heart rate sensor, which uses both infrared and visible-light LEDs and photodiodes.[70]

All versions of the first-generation Apple Watch have 8 GB of storage; the operating system allows the user to store up to 2 GB of music and 75 MB of photos. When the Apple Watch is paired with an iPhone, all music on that iPhone is also available to be controlled and accessed from the Apple Watch.[71] Software support for the first Apple Watch ended with watchOS 4.3.2.[72]


Second generation (Series 1 and 2)
--------------------------------------------------
The second generation Apple Watch has two models; the Apple Watch Series 1 and Apple Watch Series 2.

The Series 1 has a variant of the dual-core Apple S2 processor with GPS removed, known as the Apple S1P. It has a lower starting price than first generation.[73] The Series 1 was sold only in Aluminium casings.

The Series 2 has the dual-core Apple S2 processor, water resistance to 50 meters, a display twice as bright, at 1,000 nits, and a GPS receiver.[73][48] The Series 2 was sold in casings of anodized aluminum, stainless steel and ceramic.

The Apple Watch Edition Series 2 is the first Apple Watch model to add the new White ceramic case color option. Both Yellow Gold and Rose Gold 18K gold case color options have been removed.

The Apple Watch Nike+ Series 2 is the first Apple Watch model available as the Nike, Inc. collaborate special option.

The Apple Watch Series 1 and Apple Watch Series 2 are the final Apple Watch models available with Yellow Gold and Rose Gold aluminum case color options. They have an advertised 18 hours of battery life.

The software support for both Apple Watch Series 1 and Apple Watch Series 2 ended with watchOS 6.3.


Third generation (Series 3)
--------------------------------------------------
The Apple Watch Series 3 features a faster processor, the dual-core S3, Bluetooth 4.2 (compared to 4.0 on older models), a built-in altimeter for measuring flights of stairs climbed, increased RAM size, and is available in a variant with LTE cellular connectivity. Siri is able to speak through the onboard speaker on Apple Watch Series 3 due to the increased processing speed of the Watch.[74]

Series 3 features LTE cellular connectivity for the first time in an Apple Watch, enabling users to make phone calls, iMessage and stream Apple Music and Podcasts directly on the watch, independent of an iPhone. The LTE model contains an eSIM[75] and shares the same mobile number as the user's iPhone.[76]

The Apple Watch Series 3 is the first Apple Watch model to add the new Gold aluminum case color option to match the color introduced with the iPhone 8 in 2017. Both Yellow Gold and Rose Gold aluminum case color options have been removed. It is now available in Space Gray, Silver and Gold aluminum case color options, available in Space Black and Silver stainless steel case color options.

The Apple Watch Edition Series 3 is the first and only Apple Watch model to add the new Gray ceramic case color option. It is available in White and Gray ceramic case color.

The software support for the Apple Watch Series 3 ended with watchOS 8.8.1.


Fourth generation (Series 4)
--------------------------------------------------
The Apple Watch Series 4[78] is the first prominent redesign of the Apple Watch, featuring larger displays with thinner bezels and rounded corners, and a slightly rounder, thinner chassis with a redesigned ceramic back. Internally there is a new S4 64-bit dual-core processor, capable of up to double the S3's performance, upgraded 16 GB storage, and a new electrical heart sensor. The microphone was moved to the opposite side between the side button and the digital crown to improve call quality. Other changes include the digital crown incorporating haptic feedback with the Apple Haptic Engine and includes the new Apple-designed W3 wireless chip.

The ECG system has received clearance from the United States Food and Drug Administration, a first ever for a consumer device,[79] and is supported by the American Heart Association.[80] The Series 4 can also detect falls, and can automatically contact emergency services unless the user cancels the outgoing call.

The watch received mostly positive reviews from critics. TechRadar gave it a score of 4.5/5, calling it one of the top smartwatches, while criticizing the short battery life.[81] Digital Trends gave it a score of 5/5, calling it Apple's best product and praising the design, build quality, and software, among others, while criticizing the battery life.[82] CNET gave it a score of 8.2/10, calling it the "best overall smartwatch around", while criticizing the battery life and lack of watch face options.[83] T3 gave it a score of 5/5, calling it a "truly next-gen smartwatch" due to its thinner body and bigger screen compared to the Series 3, and health features.[84]

The Apple Series 4 is the first Apple Watch model to add the new Gold stainless steel color option to match the color introduced with the iPhone XS in 2018. It is now available in Space Gray, Silver and Gold aluminum case color options, available in Space Black, Silver and Gold stainless steel case color options. All the ceramic case color options have been removed until the launch of the Apple Watch Edition Series 5 in 2019.

Following the announcement at WWDC 2024, The Apple Watch Series 4 alongside the Apple Watch Series 5 and the first-generation Apple Watch SE won't support the software update to the watchOS 11.[85]


Fifth generation (Series 5 and first-generation SE)
--------------------------------------------------
The Apple Watch Series 5 was announced on September 10, 2019.[86] Its principal improvements over its predecessor were the addition of a compass and an always-on display with a low-power display driver capable of refresh rates as low as once per second. Additional new features include International Emergency Calling, enabling emergency calls in over 150 countries, a more energy-efficient S5 processor,[87] improved ambient light sensor, and storage doubled to 32 GB. The release of the Series 5 also brought back the "Edition" model, with a ceramic model absent from the previous generation. A new titanium model was also included in two colors: natural and Space Black.[88]

At its September 2020 product introduction event, Apple also announced the Apple Watch SE, a lower-cost model, similar to the iPhone SE.[89] The SE incorporates the same always-on altimeter as the Series 6,[90] but uses the previous-generation S5 processor and previous- (i.e. second) generation optical heart rate sensor; does not include ECG and blood oximeter sensors or an always-on display; and does not include ultra-wideband (UWB) or 5 GHz Wi-Fi communication capabilities.

The Series 5 and above (including the SE model introduced in 2020) also incorporate enhanced hardware- and software-based battery and performance management functionality.[91]

Critics generally gave it a positive review. CNET gave it a score of 4/5, concluding, "The Apple Watch continues to be one of the best smartwatches, but it remains limited by being an iPhone accessory for now."[92] Digital Trends gave it a score of 4.5/5.[93] The Verge gave it a score of 9/10.[94]

The Apple Watch Series 5 was available in Space Gray, Silver, and Gold aluminum case color options, as well as Space Black, Silver, and Gold stainless steel case color options.

The Apple Watch Edition Series 5 was the final Apple Watch model available with White ceramic case color option. It was the first Apple Watch model to add the new Natural and Space Black titanium case color options.

The first-generation Apple Watch SE was discontinued following the release of the second-generation Apple Watch SE in 2022.

Following Apple's annual product launch events, including Apple WWDC 2024, The Apple Watch Series 4, Series 5, and the first-generation Apple Watch SE no longer support major software upgrades, starting with watchOS 11 and onwards.[85]


Sixth generation (Series 6)
--------------------------------------------------
The Apple Watch Series 6 was announced on September 15, 2020, during an Apple Special Event and began shipping on September 18. Its principal improvement over its predecessor is the inclusion of a sensor to monitor blood oxygen saturation.[95]

Additional features include a new Apple S6 utilizing the energy-efficient Thunder cores from the A13 Bionic that is up to 20% faster than the Apple S4 and Apple S5,[89] a 2.5× brighter always-on display, and an always-on altimeter.[96] The S6 incorporates an updated, third generation optical heart rate sensor and also enhanced telecommunication technology, including support for ultra-wideband (UWB) via Apple's U1 chip (which is used to locate and communicate with other devices),[97] and the ability to connect to 5 GHz Wi-Fi networks. The Series 6 watch was updated with faster charging hardware such that it completes charging in ~1.5 hours.[98] Force Touch hardware was removed, consistent with the removal of all Force Touch functionality from watchOS 7.

The Apple Watch Series 6 is the final Apple Watch model available with Space Gray and Gold (introduced with the iPhone 8 in 2017) aluminum case color options. It is the first time adding the Product Red and Blue aluminum case color options. It is available in Space Gray, Silver, Gold, Blue and Product Red aluminum case color options, available in Graphite, Silver and Gold stainless steel case color options. The Gold stainless steel case color option is now in classic yellow gold and the Graphite stainless steel case color option is the new color replacing Space Black color before the introduction with the iPhone 12 Pro in 2020.

The Apple Watch Edition Series 6 is now available in Natural and Space Black titanium case color options. The ceramic case option was removed.


Seventh generation (Series 7)
--------------------------------------------------
The Apple Watch Series 7 was announced on September 14, 2021, during an Apple Special Event.[99] Pre-orders opened on October 8, with earliest shipping dates starting on October 15.

Succeeding from the Apple S6, the Apple S7 is the second time utilizing the energy-efficient Thunder cores from the A13 Bionic.

Enhancements relative to the prior-generation Series 6 watch include a more rounded design with a case 1 mm larger than the Series 6; a display that is 70% brighter indoors and approximately 20% larger; improved durability via a crack-resistant front crystal;[100] IP6X certification for resistance to dust; 33% faster charging via improved internal electronics and an enhanced, USB-C based fast-charging cable; support for BeiDou (China's satellite navigation system); and the availability of an on-screen keyboard that can be tapped or swiped.[101] The Series 7 is also equipped with new hardware that enables ultra-rapid, short-range wireless data transfer at 60.5 GHz, though Apple has not fully explained this new functionality.[102]

The Apple Watch Edition Series 7 is the final Apple Watch model to be available in Natural and Space Black titanium case color options.

The Apple Watch Series 7 is now available in Midnight, Starlight, Blue, Green and Product Red aluminum case color option, available in Graphite, Silver and Gold (introduced with the Apple Watch Series 6 and the iPhone 12 Pro in 2020) stainless steel case color option. Both Space Gray and Gold (introduced with iPhone 8 in 2017) aluminum case color options have been removed. The Silver aluminum case color option was unavailable until the launch of the Apple Watch Series 8 in 2022.


Eighth generation (Series 8, SE (2nd generation) and Ultra)
--------------------------------------------------
The Apple Watch Series 8, the second-generation Apple Watch SE, and the Apple Watch Ultra were announced during Apple's "Far out" event on September 7, 2022. Pre-orders opened on the same day, with the Series 8 and 2nd gen SE shipping on September 16, while the Ultra shipped on September 23.[103]

Succeeding from the Apple S7, the Apple S8 is the final processor of the Apple Watch to utilize the energy-efficient Thunder cores from the A13 Bionic.

Enhancements in the Series 8, relative to the prior-generation Series 7 watch, include a new temperature sensor and more precise accelerometers, and Crash Detection. Aluminum case models are available in Midnight, Silver, Starlight and Product Red, and the stainless steel models are available in gold, silver, and graphite finishes. The Blue and Green case colors are discontinued, and the Series 8 is not available with a titanium case.[104]

The Apple Watch Ultra is a new high-end model which Apple positioned towards endurance athletes and outdoor recreation (competing with offerings from companies such as Garmin and Polar); it shares most of its hardware with the Series 8, but it has a larger display and 49 mm band, a rugged titanium casing, a brighter display with a flat front crystal, an additional "Action" button that can be mapped to different apps and functions, integrated multi-band GPS, a water temperature sensor, and a larger battery which Apple rated at 36 hours of usage without using power saving modes.[105]

The second—generation Apple Watch SE is available in Midnight, Silver and Starlight case color options. The Space Gray and Gold case color options have been discontinued. It retains the form factor of the previous SE, which was itself very similar to the Series 4, 5 and 6.[106]


Ninth generation (Series 9 and Ultra 2)
--------------------------------------------------
The Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 were announced during Apple's "Wonderlust" event on September 12, 2023.[99] Both of these Apple Watch models have the new Apple S9 system-in-package utilizing the energy-efficient Sawtooth cores from the A16 Bionic with a faster GPU and a four-core Neural Engine, improved power efficiency, and a second-generation Ultrawide Band chip (shared with iPhone 15) with improved precision and a farther range. Their displays have a higher maximum brightness than their predecessors. Both Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 ship with watchOS 10; they support on-device Siri and a new "double tap" gesture using the index finger and thumb.[99][107]

Aluminum case models are available in Midnight, Pink, Starlight, Silver, and Product Red color options, while the stainless steel models are available in gold, silver, and graphite finishes.

For legal reasons, blood oxygen monitoring is not available on Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 models sold in the United States after January 18, 2024.[108]

Following a ruling by the International Trade Commission on a lawsuit regarding the blood oxygen monitoring feature, Apple temporarily stopped selling Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 on December 21, 2023, ahead of an import ban going into effect December 26, 2023. At the time, 9to5Mac reported, "Apple says that the ITC’s ban only impacts sales of the Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 because those devices offer blood oxygen monitoring capabilities." A US Federal Appeals Court paused the import ban pending a US Customs and Border Protection ruling on whether Apple's changes would be enough to avoid the patent dispute, and Apple resumed sales on December 27, 2023.

As of May 2024, there have been no updates made to the Series 9 / Ultra 2 blood oxygen sensor issues.


Carbon neutrality claims
--------------------------------------------------
Apple markets the Series 9 and Ultra 2 as its first-ever carbon-neutral products (depending on the selected case material and band) due to a combination of cutting the carbon dioxide emissions per watch manufactured and sold (Apple claims a reduction of 78% for the Series 9 and 81% for the Ultra 2[112]) and the company's purchases of forestry and nature-based carbon offsets and credits—which some criticized for being misleading due to reliability issues in carbon accounting for forestry carbon offsets.[110]

Most of Apple's claimed emissions reductions were driven by renewable energy requirements imposed on suppliers;[109][111] other factors include increased use of recycled materials, and a lower reliance on shipping products by plane, which is highly carbon-intensive.[110] Apple says the watches' manufacturing relies on "100% clean electricity", though this partly relies on Apple investing in clean-energy projects to offset suppliers' use of electricity produced from fossil fuels. NewClimate Institute, a non-profit, said Apple's "100 per cent clean energy" claim was "highly contentious, since Apple’s major suppliers continue to have very low renewable electricity shares".[113]

The carbon offsets used by Apple follow standards set by Verra,[114] the Climate, Community & Biodiversity Alliance, and the Forest Stewardship Council.[109] However, some investigative reporting has indicated that 94% of Verra's rainforest carbon offsets were allegedly "worthless" and that the standard may worsen global warming.[115][114] Niklas Kaskeala, chair of the non-profit Compensate Foundation, said Apple's tree-planting offsets had "systemic flaws"; the Financial Times found that in one Apple conservation scheme, newly planted trees were chopped down within a decade, releasing absorbed carbon back into the atmosphere, that most of the planted trees were eucalyptus, posing monoculture concerns, and that only 1% of the land was dedicated to regrowing native tree species.[113]

On September 20, 2023, the European Union announced that it would ban most uses of the term "carbon neutral" in advertising by 2026, including claims that are based on carbon offsets, to address greenwashing and misleading advertising. This decision was praised by Monique Goyens, director-general of EU consumer group BEUC, who also called Apple's claims "bogus" and scientifically inaccurate. Gilles Dufrasne, policy officer at non-profit Carbon Market Watch, said it was "misleading to consumers" for Apple to give "the impression that buying the Watch has no impact on the climate at all", based on what he described as "accounting tricks". Other environmental groups criticized Apple's emphasis on carbon emissions without accounting for e-waste, due to the difficulty of repairing these products.[113][116][117] Berkeley Carbon Trading Project director Barbara Haya praised the products' ~80% emissions reduction, but also criticized Apple's use of the term "carbon neutral" in advertising.[110]


Tenth generation (Series 10)
--------------------------------------------------
The Apple Watch Series 10 was announced at an Apple event on September 9, 2024. The device features its thinnest design ever, measuring 10% thinner than the Series 9. It has the largest display Apple has ever built for a wearable device, larger than even the Apple Watch Ultra, with up to 30% more screen area. The display allows for an additional line of text, enhancing the visibility of messages, mail, and news.

Succeeding from the Apple S9, the Apple S10 is the second time utilizing the energy-efficient Sawtooth cores from the A16 Bionic.

The Series 10 introduces a wider aspect ratio with rounded corners for both the display and case. The display is also 40% brighter when viewed at an angle, improving visibility, and updates once per second in Always On mode, compared to the previous rate of once per minute.[118]

Apple also introduced a new glossy aluminum finish in jet black, polished using silicon nanoparticles for a specialized surface shine. Other finish options include rose gold and silver aluminum, which are up to 10% lighter than previous models. Additionally, a new titanium finish, which is 20% lighter and carbon-neutral, replaces the stainless steel option from earlier generations.

The Apple Watch Series 10 retains 50 meters of water resistance and is the fastest-charging Apple Watch to date, reaching 80% battery in 30 minutes. The device features an 18-hour battery life.

The Apple Watch Series 10 also includes a sleep apnea detector, pending FDA approval, which is also planned to be supported by the Apple Watch Series 9 and the Apple Watch Ultra 2.

To enhance phone call quality, the Series 10 incorporates a neural network that suppresses background noise for clearer conversations. The fitness features have been expanded to include tracking for kayakers, canoers, and rowers, along with a Tides App and new depth and water temperature sensors.

Prices for the Apple Watch Series 10 start at $399, with preorders available immediately. The device was released on September 20, 2024.[119]

The Apple Watch Series 10 received sales ban in Indonesia since October 2024.[120]


Software
--------------------------------------------------
watchOS is a distinct operating system designed specifically for Apple Watch. While based on iOS, which is used in iPhones, it offers a tailored experience for the smaller screen and wrist-worn form factor.

Features:

Apple Watch runs watchOS, whose interface is around a home screen with circular app icons, which can be changed to a list view in the devices settings. The OS can be navigated using the touchscreen or the crown on the side of the watch.[52] During its debut, the first generation Apple Watch needed to be paired with an iPhone 5 or later running iOS 8.2 or later; this version of iOS introduced the Apple Watch app, which is used to pair the watch with an iPhone, customize settings and loaded apps, and highlight compatible apps from the App Store.[52]

The Apple Watch is capable of receiving notifications, messages, and phone calls via a paired iPhone.[52] "Glances" allowed users to swipe between pages containing widget-like displays of information; however, this feature was replaced by a new Control Center. watchOS also supports Handoff to send content from Apple Watch to an iOS or macOS device,[52] and act as a viewfinder for an iPhone camera,[121] Siri is also available for voice commands, and is capable of responding with voice prompts on the Series 3 watches.[52] Apple Watch also supports Apple Pay, and enables its use with older iPhone models that do not contain near-field communication (NFC) support.[52]

Apple Watch's default apps are designed to interact with their iOS counterparts, such as Mail, Phone, Calendar, Messages, Maps, Music, Photos, Reminders, Remote (which can control iTunes and Apple TV), Stocks, and Wallet.[52] Using the Activity and Workout apps, a user can track their physical activity and send data back to the iPhone for use in its Health app and other HealthKit-enabled software.[52] With watchOS 3, Reminders, Home, Find My Friends, Heart Rate, and Breathe were added to the stock apps.


Version history
--------------------------------------------------
At WWDC 2015, Tim Cook announced watchOS 2.0; described by CNET as a "significant revamp", it included a new software development kit that allows more direct access to the device's hardware, new watch faces, the ability to reply to an e-mail, and other features.[122] WatchOS 2.0 was released in September 2015.[123] Following the software update, some users experienced issues with lag.[124]

watchOS 3.0 was announced at WWDC 2016, with a priority on performance. Users are able to keep apps running in memory as well as receive background updates and refreshed information. Other updates include a new Dock invoked with the side button to replace the performance-laden Glances, an updated Control Center, and new reply options on Messages. Several new watch faces have also been added, including Minnie Mouse, along with the ability to switch watch faces from the lock screen simply by swiping. A new feature called SOS allows users to hold the dock button to make a call to the local emergency line and pull up the user's Medical ID. Another feature is Activity Sharing, which allows sharing of workouts with friends and even sending their heartbeats to one another. A new app called Breathe guides users through breathing exercises throughout the day, with visuals and haptic feedback. It was made available to the public in September 2016.

watchOS 3.1 was released to the public in October 2016, and watchOS 3.2 was released in March 2017.[125] Both updates added minor improvements and bug fixes.

watchOS 4.0 was announced at WWDC 2017 and released to the public in September 2017. watchOS 4 features a proactive Siri watch face, personalized activity coaching, and an entirely redesigned music app. It also introduces Apple GymKit, a technology platform to connect workouts with cardio equipment.

watchOS 4.3 was released in March 2018. It introduced support for Nightstand mode in portrait orientation. It brought back the ability for music playing on the iPhone to be controlled using the Music app on the Apple Watch and also enabled control of playback and volume on Apple's HomePod. Other new features included a new charging animation and a new app loading animation. Activity data was added to the Siri watch face, and the battery complication more accurately reports battery life.

watchOS 5.0 was first shown to the public at the San Jose WWDC developer conference held by Apple. It introduced an instant watch-to-watch walkie-talkie mode, all-new Podcasts app, raise-wrist-to-speak Siri, customizable Control Center, and the ability to access the notification center and control center from apps. Other features included support for WebKit to view web pages, six new watch faces, and new workout running features.[126] It was released to the public in September 2018.[127] On the newest release of watchOS beta the sleep feature was shown on screen, this would eliminate the need to use third-party apps.

watchOS 6.0 was released to the public in September 2019. It introduced more native iOS apps such as voice memos, calculator, and a native watchOS app store. watchOS 6.0 also introduced new features such as the noise app that allows one to measure ambient sound in decibels, menstrual tracking, and new watch faces. Other features include Siri being able to tell users what music they are listening to, activity trends, and a new UI framework for developers.

watchOS 7.0 was announced on June 22, 2020, at the WWDC, and released on September 16, 2020; new functions include sleep tracking, additional watch faces, handwashing detection and new workouts such as dancing.[128]

watchOS 8.0 was announced on June 7, 2021, at the WWDC, and released on September 20, 2021. It replaces the Breathe app with a new Mindfulness app, and adds a Focus mode as well as a Portrait Watch Face, updates to the Messages and Home apps, Contacts and Find My apps, and a redesigned Photos app.

watchOS 9.0 was released to public on September 13, 2022. It enhances the Workout display with new views of metrics like Activity rings, Heart Rate Zones, Power, and Elevation. It also supports better sleep tracking and additional watch faces.

watchOS 10.0 was announced on June 5, 2023, at WWDC, and released on September 18, 2023. It includes a major redesign of all stock watchOS apps, more detailed metrics available for cycling workouts, and new "Smart Stacks", stacks of widgets available from the clock.


Third-party apps
--------------------------------------------------
In watchOS 1, third-party WatchKit applications run in the background on the iPhone as an application extension while a set of native user interface resources are installed on Apple Watch.[129] Thus, watchOS apps must be bundled within their respective iOS app, and are synced to the watch either manually, or automatically upon installation of the phone app.[52]

With the release of watchOS 2, Apple made it mandatory for new watch apps to be developed with the watchOS 2 SDK from June 1, 2016, onwards; no third-party languages or SDKs can be used to develop apps.[130] This allowed for developers to create native apps that are run on the watch itself, thus improving the responsiveness of third-party apps.

In watchOS 5 and earlier, all watchOS apps are dependent apps – the watchOS app relies on an iOS companion app in order to function properly.[131] In watchOS 6 or later, developers are able to create completely independent watchOS apps, and no longer require an app to be installed on the paired iPhone. This was assisted by the introduction of a separate App Store on the Apple Watch itself.[132]


Reception
--------------------------------------------------
Following the announcement, initial impressions from technology and watch industry observers were varied; the watch was praised by some for its "design, potential capabilities and eventual usefulness",[133] while others offered criticism of these same aspects.[133] Venture capitalist Marc Andreessen said he "can't wait" to try it,[134] and Steve Jobs' biographer Walter Isaacson described it as "extremely cool" and an example of future technology that is "much more embedded into our lives".[135] Evan Dashevsky of PC Magazine said it offered nothing new in terms of functionality compared to the Moto 360, except the customizable vibration notifications.[136] In November 2014, Apple Watch was listed by Time as one of the 25 Best Inventions of 2014.[137]

Initial reviews for the device have been generally positive with some caveats.[138] Reviewers praised the watch's potential ability to integrate into everyday life and the overall design of the product, but noted issues of speed and price. Many reviewers described the watch as functional and convenient, while also noting failure to offer as much potential functionality as preceding smartphones. Farhad Manjoo of The New York Times mentioned the device's steep learning curve, stating it took him "three long, often confusing and frustrating days" to become accustomed to watchOS 1, but loved it thereafter.[139] Some reviewers also compared it to competing products, such as Android Wear devices, and claimed "The Smartwatch Finally Makes Sense".[140] Reviewers had mixed opinions on battery life though, with Geoffrey Fowler of The Wall Street Journal saying "the battery lives up to its all-day billing, but sometimes just barely,"[140] and others compared it to the Samsung Gear 2, which "strolls through three days of moderate usage."[141] Tim Bradshaw of the Financial Times used several applications over a period of days. He concluded that there is no "killer application" so far besides telling the time, which is the basic function of a wristwatch anyhow.[142]

When using the Apple Watch, some users have reported issues using the heart monitoring feature due to permanent skin conditions, including tattoos. The Watch uses photoplethysmography technology (PPG) that utilizes the green LEDs to measure heart rates.[143][144] To gauge a user's heart rate, the watch flashes green light from the LEDs at the skin and records the amount of this light that is absorbed by the red pigment of the blood.[145] Under certain circumstances, the skin may not allow for the light absorption to be read properly and thus provide inaccurate results.[143]

Some users have complained that the logo and text on the back of the Apple Watch Sport model, primarily the space gray version,[146] can be easily worn off.[147]


Sales
--------------------------------------------------
Financial analysts offered early sales estimates from a few million to as many as 5 million in the first year.[148] Time's Tim Bajarin summarized the breadth of reactions, writing that "there is not enough information yet to determine how this product will fare when it finally reaches the market next year".[133]

Owing to the inadequacy of materials, the Apple Watch's delivery was delayed from its initial pre-order release date of April 10, 2015.[149] As a result, only 22 percent of the pre-ordered Apple Watches were dispatched in the United States during the weekend after the release date.[150] It is estimated Apple received almost one million Apple Watch pre-orders in the United States during the initial six hours of the pre-order period on April 10, 2015, after which it sold out and further orders would start delivering in June.[151] A report later on by an analyst stated that Apple Watch was already a $10 billion business during its first year.[152]

Apple has not disclosed any sales figures for the Apple Watch.[153] An estimate by IDC states Apple shipped over 12 million units in 2015.[154] In late 2016, a veteran of the Swiss watch industry said Apple sold about 20 million watches and had a market share of about 50 percent.[155] Analysts estimate Apple sold 18 million watches in 2017, 31 million in 2019, and 34 million in 2020.[156] In 2021, analysts estimated there were 100 million units in use.[157]

In 2020, Apple sold more watches than the entire Swiss watch industry– which includes Swatch and TAG Heuer among others.[158]


Controversy
--------------------------------------------------
In October 2024, the Apple Watch Series 10 received sales ban in Indonesia, as an extension from the iPhone 16's sales ban.[120] The ban is due to Apple Inc. failed to meet 40% quota requirements for local component certification (TKDN) by Indonesian government, said their minister of industry Agus Gumiwang Kartasasmita.[120][159]


Intellectual property disputes
--------------------------------------------------
In December 2019, Joseph Wiesel, a New York University cardiologist, sued Apple over allegations that the Apple Watch violates a patented method for detecting atrial fibrillation. Wiesel stated he had shared details of the patent with Apple in September 2017; the company refused to negotiate.[160]

Following Apple's announcement of the Series 7, an independent software development company filed a lawsuit against Apple alleging inappropriate copying of the software keyboard functionality from an app that Apple had previously rejected from its App Store.[161]

In October 2023, the United States International Trade Commission (ITC) ruled that Apple Watch products infringed upon patents for light-based pulse oximetry that are owned by medical technology company Masimo. The company alleged that Apple had approached Masimo with offers to acquire or otherwise partner with the company, and went on to poach engineers from Masimo to develop the infringing technology after it declined the offers. This ruling would allow the ITC to impose an import ban, provided it is not overruled by presidential veto power within a 60-day review period ending December 25. Apple denied the allegations, stating that it had solicited partnerships with multiple vendors, declined to work with Masimo because they were not in the consumer market, and accused Masimo of attempting to "use the ITC to keep a potentially lifesaving product from millions of US consumers while making way for their own watch that copies Apple."[162]

On December 18, 2023, Apple began to halt sales of Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 in the United States.[163] On December 27, 2023, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit granted a stay on the import ban pending an appeal.[164] On January 12, 2024, Masimo disclosed that the ITC had approved modifications to the products that would remove the infringing technology.[165] Blood oxygen monitoring is not available on Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 models sold in the United States after January 18, 2024, designated by part numbers ending in "LW/A".[108]

List of iPhone models

The iPhone 5 is a smartphone that was developed and marketed by Apple Inc. It is the 6th generation iPhone, succeeding the iPhone 4s, and preceding both the iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c. It was formally unveiled as part of a press event on September 12, 2012, and subsequently released on September 21, 2012. The iPhone 5 was the first iPhone to be announced in September, and setting a trend for subsequent iPhone releases, the first iPhone to be completely developed under the guidance of Tim Cook and the last iPhone to be overseen by Steve Jobs. The iPhone 5's design was used three times, first with the iPhone 5 itself in 2012, then with the iPhone 5s in 2013, and finally with the first-generation iPhone SE in 2016.

The iPhone 5 featured major design changes in comparison to its predecessor. These included an aluminum-based body which was thinner and lighter than previous models, a taller 4-inch screen with a nearly 16:9 aspect ratio, the Apple A6 system-on-chip, LTE support, and Lightning, a new compact dock connector which replaced the 30-pin design used by previous iPhone models. This was the second iPhone after the iPhone 4s to include Apple's new Sony-made 8 MP camera.

Apple began taking pre-orders on September 14, 2012, and over two million were received within 24 hours. Initial demand for the iPhone 5 exceeded the supply available at launch on September 21, 2012, and was described by Apple as "extraordinary", with pre-orders having sold twenty times faster than its predecessors. While reception to the iPhone 5 was generally positive, consumers and reviewers noted hardware issues, such as an unintended purple hue in photos taken, and the phone's coating being prone to chipping. Reception was also mixed over Apple's decision to switch to a different dock connector design, as the change affected iPhone 5's compatibility with accessories that were otherwise compatible with previous iterations of the line.

The iPhone 5 was officially discontinued by Apple on September 10, 2013, with the announcement of its successors, the iPhone 5s and the iPhone 5c. The iPhone 5 has the joint second-shortest lifespan of any iPhone ever produced with only twelve months in production, breaking with Apple's standard practice of selling an existing iPhone model at a reduced price upon the release of a new model. This was broken by the iPhone X which only had ten-months in production from November 2017 to September 2018, and tied with the iPhone XS which had twelve-months from September 2018 to September 2019.

It was replaced as a midrange and then an entry-level device by the iPhone 5c; the 5c internal hardware specifications are almost identical to the 5 albeit having a less expensive polycarbonate exterior shell. The iPhone 5 supports iOS 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10. The iPhone 5 does not support iOS 11 due to it dropping support for 32-bit devices. The iPhone 5 is the second iPhone to support five major versions of iOS after the iPhone 4s.


History
--------------------------------------------------
Rumors about the iPhone 5 began shortly after the announcement of the iPhone 4s, though detailed leaks did not emerge until June 2012.[12] On July 30, 2012, reports pinpointed the dates on which the iPhone 5 would be unveiled and released, along with some accurate predictions of its features.[13] On September 4, 2012, Apple announced they would be hosting an event at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco on September 12, 2012. A shadow of the numeral 5 was featured in the invitations sent to the media, suggesting that the next iPhone would be unveiled at the event.[14]

At the unveiling, Apple announced the iPhone 5 and also introduced new iPod Nano and iPod Touch models. They also stated that pre-orders would be accepted starting September 14, 2012.[1][15] Over two million pre-orders were received within 24 hours.[5][16] The iPhone 5 was made available for sale to the public on September 21, 2012.[17] Initial demand for the new phone exceeded the record set by its predecessor, the iPhone 4s, by selling over 5 million units in the first three days.[18] On November 30, 2012, Apple added an unlocked version of the iPhone 5 to their online US store, with the 16 GB model starting at US$649.[19][20]

The iPhone 5 was officially discontinued by Apple on September 10, 2013, with the announcement of its successors, the iPhone 5s and the iPhone 5c.[21] While the 5c shared almost the same internal hardware as the iPhone 5, the 5c used a lower-cost polycarbonate plastic case in place of the original 5's aluminum form. The introduction of the 5c deviated from Apple's previous market strategy, where the previous iPhone model would remain in production, but sold at a lower price point below the new model.[21]

On April 28, 2014, Apple initiated an out of warranty recall program to replace any failing power buttons of iPhone 5 models which were manufactured prior to March 2013 at no cost.[22] On August 23, 2014, Apple announced a program to replace batteries of iPhone 5 models that "may suddenly experience shorter battery life or need to be charged more frequently" which were sold between September 2012 and January 2013.[23][24]


Litigation
--------------------------------------------------
Following the release of the iPhone 5, Samsung announced that it was filing a lawsuit against Apple for infringing eight of its patents. The case was scheduled to begin in 2014.[25] In a statement, Samsung said it had "little choice but to take the steps necessary to protect our innovations and intellectual property rights".[26] Litigation between the two involving patent infringement has been ongoing and is being fought in several court cases around the world.[27]


Production
--------------------------------------------------
The components and labor required to construct the most basic iPhone 5 are estimated to cost US$207, which is US$19 more than the cost of components for the corresponding iPhone 4s model. The LTE module in the iPhone 5 alone costs $34, $10 more than the cellular module in the iPhone 4s. Similarly, screens used in the iPhone 5 cost $44, which is $7 more than the screen of its predecessor. Mashable noted that the profit margin of selling each device is "huge" as the iPhone 5 retails for US$649.[28][29]

After the announcement of the device, a lack of supply was evident. This was due to a shortage of components such as the screen. Reports emerged, stating that Sharp was unable to ship the screen before the debut of the iPhone 5, and other manufacturers reported that it was difficult to keep up with demand. As a result, the number of pre-orders rose due to the uncertainty of stock at retail stores, and the delivery dates for pre-orders were postponed to dates that were after the initial release date of the device.[30]


Quality control inspectors strike
--------------------------------------------------
China Labor Watch, a New York State–based NGO, reported that "three to four thousand" Foxconn workers who work at the iPhone 5 production plant in Zhengzhou stopped working on October 5, 2012.[31] The strikes occurred after Apple implemented a stricter quality standard on their products, which includes a 0.02 mm restriction on indentations inflicted during production, and imposed demands related to scratches on frames and back covers.[31] The strikes were also attributed to the employer forcing employees to work on a public holiday. The report stated training was inadequate for quality demands expected and led to employees producing products that did not meet standards. During the strike, conflicts between quality control inspectors and employees resulted in brawls. China Labor Watch also claimed that concerns raised by inspectors were not addressed by factory management.[31] Foxconn spokesmen admitted that a micromanagement problem exists, but also said that there were only 300 to 400 workers absent and the conflicts did not influence production processes.[32] In November 2012 Foxconn chairman Terry Gou reported that the delay in production was due to undisclosed difficulties in assembly.[33]


Features
--------------------------------------------------

Operating system and software
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 5 features iOS, Apple's mobile operating system.[34] The user interface of iOS is based on the concept of direct manipulation, using multi-touch gestures. Interface control elements consist of sliders, switches, and buttons.[35] Interaction with the OS includes gestures such as swipe, tap, pinch, and reverse pinch, all of which have specific definitions within the context of the iOS operating system and its multi-touch interface. Internal accelerometers are used by some applications to respond to shaking the device (one common result is the undo command) or rotating it vertically (one common result is switching from portrait to landscape mode).[35]

The iPhone 5 is shipped with iOS 6, which was released on September 19, 2012.[34] Many of the iPhone 5's features that work specifically with the included iOS 6.0 operating system only worked in certain territories on release.[36] Apple has said this is a rolling program, which will take longer to implement across more regions.[37]

The phone can act as a hotspot, sharing its internet connection over WiFi, Bluetooth, or USB,[38] and also accesses the App Store, an online application distribution platform for iOS developed and maintained by Apple. The service allows users to browse and download applications from the iTunes Store that were developed with Xcode and the iOS SDK and were published through Apple.

The iPhone 5 can play music, movies, television shows, ebooks, audiobooks, and podcasts and can sort its media library by songs, artists, albums, videos, playlists, genres, composers, podcasts, audiobooks, and compilations. Options are always presented alphabetically, except in playlists, which retain their order from iTunes.[39] Users can rotate their device horizontally to landscape mode to access Cover Flow. Like on iTunes, this feature shows the different album covers in a scroll-through photo library. Scrolling is achieved by swiping a finger across the screen. Alternatively, headset controls can be used to pause, play, skip, and repeat tracks. On the iPhone 5, the volume can be changed with the included Apple Earphones, and the Voice Control feature can be used to identify a track, play songs in a playlist or by a specific artist, or create a Genius playlist.[39]

Like the iPhone 4s, the iPhone 5 has Siri,[39] that allows the user to operate the iPhone by spoken commands. The software was improved in iOS 6 to include the ability to make restaurant reservations, launch apps, dictate Facebook or Twitter updates, retrieve movie reviews and detailed sports statistics.[40]

On the iPhone 5, texting can be aided by the voice assistant, which converts speech to text.[39] In addition to regular texting, messaging on the iPhone 5 supports iMessage, a specialized instant messaging program and service that allows unlimited texting to other Apple devices running iOS 5 or later. This supports the inclusion of content such as images and sound in text messages, integration with the device's voice-controlled software assistant, and read acknowledgments for sent messages. Input to the device comes from a keyboard displayed on the multi-touch screen or by voice-to-text by speaking into the microphone. Entered text is supported by predictive and suggestion software; there is a multi-language spell-checker which recognizes many regional accents of different languages.[39]

iOS 6 features several new and/or updated apps, which includes Apple Maps and Passbook. Apple's built-in Maps app, which replaced the former Maps app powered by Google Maps, had been universally derided and lacked many features present in competing maps apps.[41][42] It uses Apple's new vector-based engine that eliminates lag, making for smoother zooming. New to Maps is turn-by-turn navigation spoken directions, 3D views in some major cities and real-time traffic.[40][43] iOS 6 is able to retrieve documents such as boarding passes, admission tickets, coupons and loyalty cards through its new Passbook app. An iOS device with Passbook can be scanned under a reader to process a mobile payment at locations that have compatible hardware. The app has context-aware features such as notifications for relevant coupons when in the immediate vicinity of a given store.[40][44]

Facebook comes integrated through Apple's native apps with iOS 6. Facebook features can be directly accessed from within native apps such as Calendar which can sync Facebook events, or use Facebook's like button from within the Apple App Store.[40]

New privacy settings are available to the user. In addition to location services, the following have been added in iOS 6: photos (already partially restricted in iOS 5), contacts (address book), calendars, reminders, Bluetooth sharing, Twitter, Facebook, and Sina Weibo. iOS 6 also comes with a "Limit ad tracking" user control in the general settings menu to allow users the option to prevent targeted advertising. Apple's Advertising Identifier replaces the company's existing Unique Device Identification (UDID) standard. Advertising networks not yet using Apple's Advertising Identifier device identifier standard would not be affected, although Apple will require the standard in the future.[45]


Design
--------------------------------------------------
Apple emphasized the improved build quality of the iPhone 5 at its press event.[15] The frame used in previous versions was redesigned to use an aluminum composite frame.[46] The iPhone 4 and iPhone 4s used stainless steel instead of aluminium due to Steve Jobs' preference for the metal which he thought, "looks beautiful when it wears".[47]

The iPhone 5 is 18% thinner, 20% lighter, and has 12% less overall volume than its predecessor, the iPhone 4s.[48] The phone's aluminum body is 0.30 in (7.6 mm) thick. At the September 2012 conference Apple claimed it was the thinnest smartphone in the world at 7.6 mm, though that claim was disputed as the Chinese Oppo Finder was thinner and some other smartphones could be considered to be thinner, depending upon where thickness is measured. The Oppo Finder measured 6.65 mm (0.262 in) at its thinnest point and 7.1 mm (0.28 in) at its thickest point making it overall thinner than the iPhone.[49][50][51][52] This design was used three times, first with the iPhone 5 in 2012, then with the 5s in 2013, and finally with the first-generation iPhone SE in 2016.


Hardware
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 5 uses a system on chip (SoC), called the Apple A6.[17][53][54] The SoC comprises a 1.3 GHz dual-core processor, 1 GB of RAM and a tri-core PowerVR SGX543MP4 running at 266 MHz.[55][56] The iPhone 5's operating memory (LPDDR2-1066 eDRAM) was doubled, from 512 MB to 1 GB. Storage capacities available are fixed at 16, 32 or 64 GB, the same as the 4s; plug-in memory cards are not supported.[57] The two color options are black (with black glass and slate-colored metal trim), and white (with white ceramic and silver-colored metal trim); again the same color options (though differently implemented) as its predecessor the 4s had.[58] The iPhone 5 retains the 8 megapixel back camera on the iPhone 4s, but has improved low-light performance, and has a 40% faster photo capture[59] than its predecessors, while having a purple hue when a strong source of light is present in the photograph.[60] The front camera, which is accessible through the FaceTime and camera app has a lower resolution, at 1.2 megapixels. The rechargeable lithium-ion battery with a charge capacity of 1440mAh[9] is built in and cannot be replaced by the user; it is rated at ≤225 hours of standby time and ≤8 hours of talk time. There are three separate models of the phone available: one supporting CDMA and two GSM versions.[61][62] This can have knock-on effects for which version of the device will actually work in which countries/regions.[citation needed] The phone takes a nano-SIM, smaller than the micro-SIM of the iPhone 4 and iPhone 4s.[63]

Hardware benchmarking conducted using Geekbench and GLBenchmark validates several claims that Apple included on their website and mentioned at the unveiling of the device, these include two times faster and two times the graphics performance. In the Geekbench overall hardware assessment, the iPhone 5 received a score that was approximately 2.5 times higher than the iPhone 4s. The benchmark conducted using GLBenchmark for the iPhone 5 returned a score that was 2 times better than the iPhone 4s. The result was however inconsistent as a 3D graphics benchmark assessment using Passmark returned a score that was only approximately 1.45 times better than the iPhone 4s.[64][65] Battery life assessments conducted by AnandTech concluded that the battery life is shorter on the iPhone 5 than its predecessor when performing certain tasks, however when performing other tasks the iPhone 5 battery outlasts the iPhone 4s.[66]

The Retina Display is 1,136 × 640 pixels with an aspect ratio of almost exactly 16:9, (minus one extra row of horizontal pixels). With a diagonal of 4" it has a display size of 6.7 square inches, compared to 5.7 in iPhone 4 and 4s.[67] The pixel density remains the same as the 4s model, which is 326 pixels per inch. Screen icons of the iPhone 5 are arranged in a matrix of six rows of four icons each. The increased screen size allows the sixth row of icons to be added to the five rows that were present in the iPhone 4. In-cell touch sensor technology from Sharp slims the screen which allows for a thinner phone. The screen's color saturation is 44% greater than its predecessor.[68]

There are three microphones (placed on the front, side and back) for noise cancellation and video calls.[69]

On April 28, 2014, Apple initiated an out of warranty recall program to replace any failing power buttons of iPhone 5 models which were manufactured prior to March 2013 at no cost.[22]

On August 23, 2014, Apple announced a program to replace batteries of iPhone 5 models that "may suddenly experience shorter battery life or need to be charged more frequently" which were sold between September 2012 and January 2013.[23][24]


Accessories
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 5, as well as the iPod Touch (5th generation), iPod Nano (7th generation), iPad (4th generation), and iPad Mini feature a new dock connector named Lightning, which replaces the 30-pin Apple Dock connector introduced in 2003 by Apple on the iPod (3rd generation). The Apple Lightning connector has eight pins and all signaling is digital. This new connector is smaller than the previous one, helping the iPhone 5 to be slimmer than its predecessors.[70] Apple Lightning cables have duplicate pins on two sides of each plug, so it can be inserted either way round. Various accessories will be available to convert the Apple Lightning connector to the older 30-pin Apple Dock connector or USB,[71] although not all old accessories will work, as not all signals are available, in particular video output and the iPod Out feature for BMW automobiles.[72][73][74]

Earphones known as Apple EarPods are included with the iPhone 5 and other devices announced at the Apple media event on September 12, 2012. They superseded earphones that were included with previous generation iPhones and iPods.[75] According to technology commentators, the redesign of the earphones is aimed to improve sound quality by allowing air to travel in and out more freely.[76][77] Apple states that the redesign of their earphones allows it to "rival high-end headphones that cost hundreds of dollars more".[76] Reviews by Gizmodo and TechRadar reported that although the redesigned earphones sounded better than its predecessor, reviewers felt that quality of sound produced is poor.[78]


Network compatibility
--------------------------------------------------
AT&T, Verizon, and Sprint offer LTE access in the US,[84] while in the UK, only EE and Three are able to offer LTE access.[85] On March 26, 2013, T-Mobile announced they would begin carrying the iPhone 5, making it the first iPhone to be available on all four nationwide carriers in the United States.[86] The T-Mobile version of the iPhone features a modified version of the A1428 iPhone 5 model enabling Advanced Wireless Services (AWS) support.[87] All carriers in Canada selling the iPhone 5 have their own LTE networks, including Rogers Wireless, Fido Solutions, Bell Mobility, Virgin Mobile Canada, Telus Mobility and Koodo Mobile.[88][89]

42 officially recognized bands exist for LTE, however rollouts are coalescing around the more-popular bands, based on what historically has been made available in specific regions. In Europe, bands available for LTE include, 2.6 GHz (the 3G-expansion band) and 800 MHz (cleared of analogue TV), with 1,800 MHz appearing in a few places including the UK. In Germany, the only carrier network supported is that of T-Mobile with its 1,800 MHz band allocated to LTE.[90][91] Some countries in Europe, including Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and others—will not be able to offer LTE connectivity via the iPhone 5 to their customers on their current LTE networks, as they have already deployed LTE in the 2.6 GHz band, which the iPhone 5 does not support.[92] In November 2012, a representative of Swisscom reported that the iPhone 5 only supports LTE on networks that have been tested and certified by Apple.[93][94]

Unlike the iPhone 4s, which was the only "world phone" produced by Apple, there are three versions of the iPhone 5, which differ by the frequency used. All three work on 2G GSM/GPRS and 3G UMTS/EDGE networks on both the 800 and 1900 MHz bands used in the Americas, and the 900 and 1800 MHz bands used elsewhere. The CDMA A1429 model works on CDMA networks, such as that of Sprint and Verizon. Another version supports LTE only on the 1700/2100 MHz AWS band, and the 700 MHz band recovered after the conversion to digital television in the US (channels 52 to 56), currently the only network that supports the band is AT&T. GSM A1429 supports several other LTE bands available in other countries, such as LTE bands 1, 3, 5.[62][95]


Reception
--------------------------------------------------

Critical reception
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 5 received mainly positive reviews from commentators and reviewers. Tim Stevens from Engadget praised the iPhone 5 for its high resolution screen surpassing that of the iPhone 4s, which he considered to be one of the best phone screens available on the market. Stevens was critical of the new connector, which is incompatible with devices and cables that use the superseded 30-pin connector, although the LA Times reported that this was a change necessary to make the device smaller than its predecessor.[70] Engadget agreed that Apple fulfilled most of the promises stated on its website, such as "better battery performance", "two times the graphics performance" and "two times faster."[96] David Pogue of The New York Times considered the 4-inch Retina display a "nice but not life-changing change", and praised the Lightning connector for its size, sturdiness, and reversibility, while noting its lack of support for older accessories, remarking that "Apple has a long history of killing off technologies, inconveniently and expensively, that the public had come to love".[97] Technology columnist Ed Baig of USA Today was impressed that Apple had met the public's "lofty expectations" for the iPhone 5 in a competitive market.[98] In a repair-ability review, iFixit found the iPhone 5 easier to disassemble and repair than its predecessor.[9][99]

Wired reported that the iPhone 5 design, carried on in the iPhone 5s and first-generation iPhone SE, was regarded as "long been the golden child of Apple phone design and a benchmark for phones in general", while the succeeding iPhone 6/6s design was less critically acclaimed as it "felt a little bit wrong, as though you were holding a slick $650 bar of soap". Wired described the iPhone 5 as "elegance rooted in the way the aluminum and glass work together. It felt streamlined, yet substantial, which is different from the iPhone 6, which feels substantial in size alone. Plus, unlike the ubiquitous rounded corners of the 6, the iPhone 5 didn't really look like anything else on the market at the time". However, the iPhone 5's design was not suited to scaling up, in contrast to the iPhone 6/6s which could better accommodate the growing consumer trend towards larger screen sizes and indeed spawned the 6/6S Plus phablet models.[100][101]


Criticism
--------------------------------------------------
Reviewers and commentators were critical of the new Maps app that replaced Google Maps in iOS 6. It had been reported to contain errors such as misplacement of landmark tags, directing users to incorrect locations and poor satellite images.[102][103][104] Nine days after Maps' release, Apple issued a statement apologizing for the frustration it had caused customers and recommending that they try alternate mapping services.[105]


Errors
--------------------------------------------------
Gizmodo editor Diaz discussed the correspondence between Apple and a reader about purple flare in pictures taken on iPhone 5 camera. Apple's response to the issue was that it is normal and advised the customer to aim the camera away from bright light sources when taking photos.[106] Tests conducted by TechCrunch indicate that the problem existed on the iPhone 4s but was more distinct and pronounced on the iPhone 5.[107] Consumer Reports found that the purple haze effect occurred on several other manufacturers' phones including the Samsung Galaxy S III and Motorola Droid Razr Maxx, and that it was not less pronounced on the iPhone 4s. The report concluded that digital cameras in general, including higher-end SLRs, can all suffer from lens flare in which a purple-tinted effect was not uncommon.[108]


Problems
--------------------------------------------------
There were anecdotal claims of the coating of primarily black iPhone 5s chipping off, exposing the bright aluminium underneath. Apple executive's response to email correspondence from an affected customer summarized that it was normal for aluminum to scratch.[109][110] The term "scuffgate", a reference to "antennagate" which affected the iPhone 4, was applied by various sources such as CNET, Yahoo News, and All Things Digital to describe the scuffing issue.[111][112]

Some users reported on the Internet that the white model leaked light behind the screen, though the issue was not unique to the iPhone 5, as it also affected other Apple devices.[113]


Commercial reception
--------------------------------------------------
Techcrunch reported that the iPhone 5 sold out twenty times faster than the 4 and 4s models. Apple said that they were "blown away by the customer response".[114] Phil Schiller, Apple's vice-president of worldwide marketing, said that over two million iPhone 5 orders had been received in the first 24 hours.[5][115] AT&T said that the iPhone 5 was the fastest-selling iPhone the company had ever offered, selling over five million units on launch weekend and exceeding the supply available.[6][116][117] The release and sale of the iPhone 5 has also slowed down the growth of Android according to market share reports released by Kantar Worldpanel ComTech.[118] During the first 16 days after the phone's initial release it comprised over 20% of all phones sold in that period.[119]

J.P. Morgan's chief economist, Michael Feroli said that "sales of iPhone 5 could boost annualized US GDP growth by $3.2 billion, or $12.8 billion at an annual rate."[120] Shortly after the announcement of the iPhone 5 and preceding the launch, Apple's stock price rose to a record $705.07,[121] but within three months fell to $507.48.[122] According to the analysis of Eric Savitz, Apple's stock decline and resulting losses were not the result of any issue with the new Maps application, but disappointed investors. He points to initial hardware sales of only five million, compared to projections up to twice that, as the primary cause.[123]

Since the release of the iPhone 5, discounts on previous generation iPhones have enabled Apple to maintain a market lead in the United States and Japan, but the iPhone continued to lag behind the combined total of Android phones in the global market.[124]

List of iPhone models

The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are smartphones that were developed and marketed by Apple Inc. They are the eighth generation of the iPhone, succeeding the iPhone 5, iPhone 5c and iPhone 5s, and were announced on September 9, 2014, and released on September 19, 2014.[20] The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus jointly were themselves replaced as the flagship devices of the iPhone series by the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus on September 9, 2015. The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus include larger 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch displays, a faster processor, upgraded cameras, improved LTE and Wi-Fi connectivity and support for a near-field communications-based mobile payments offering.[21][22]

The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus received positive reviews, with critics regarding their redesign, specifications, camera, and battery life as being improvements over previous iPhone models. However, aspects of the design of iPhone 6 were also criticized, including plastic strips on the rear of the device for its antenna that disrupted the otherwise metal exterior, and the screen resolution of the standard-sized iPhone 6 being lower than other devices in its class. The iPhone 6 sold extremely well, making it the best-selling iPhone model and the most successful smartphone to date.

The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus have been the subject of several hardware issues, including most prominently, being susceptible to bending under hard pressure (dubbed "Bendgate"), and as a byproduct of this lack of rigidity, the touchscreen's internal hardware being susceptible to losing its connection to the phone's logic board (nicknamed "Touch Disease"). Additionally, some iPhone 6 Plus models were the subject of camera issues, including some with malfunctioning optical image stabilization or otherwise defects on rear cameras.

The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were moved to the midrange spot in Apple's iPhone lineup when the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus were released in September 2015. The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were discontinued in most markets on September 7, 2016, when Apple announced the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Their spot as the entry-level iPhone was replaced by the first-generation iPhone SE, which was released earlier on March 31, 2016. The iPhone 6 was relaunched with 32 GB of storage in Asian markets in February 2017 as a midrange/budget iPhone. It was later expanded to Europe,[23][24] before hitting the US markets in May 2017,[25] and Canada in July 2017.[26] The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus supported iOS 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 before being dropped by iOS 13, and they are the third to support five versions of iOS after the iPhone 4s and the iPhone 5.


History
--------------------------------------------------
From the launch of the original iPhone to the iPhone 4s, iPhones used 3.5-inch displays—which are smaller than screens used by flagship phones from competitors. The iPhone 5 and its immediate successors featured a display that was taller, but the same width as prior models, measuring at 4 inches diagonally. Following Apple's loss in smartphone market share to companies producing phones with larger displays, reports as early as January 2014 suggested Apple was preparing to launch new iPhone models with larger, 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch displays.[27][28][29] Reports prior to its unveiling also speculated Apple might use a new iPhone model to introduce a mobile payments platform using near-field communications—a technology that was incorporated into many Android phones, but had experienced a low adoption rate among users.[30]

The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus were officially unveiled during a press event at the Flint Center for Performing Arts in Cupertino, California on September 9, 2014, and released on September 19, 2014; pre-orders began on September 12, 2014, with the iPhone 6 starting at US$199 and the iPhone 6 Plus starting at US$299.[31] In China, where the iPhone 5c and 5s were the first models in the iPhone series to be released in the country on the same day as their international launch, Apple notified local wireless carriers it would be unable to release the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus on the 19th there were "details which are not ready"; local media reported the devices had not yet been approved by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, and earlier in the year, a news report by state broadcaster China Central Television alleged iPhone devices were a threat to national security because iOS 7's "frequent locations" function could expose "state secrets."[32][33]

In August 2015, Apple initiated a replacement program for some early iPhone 6 Plus models that were found to have potentially faulty cameras that could be causing photos to appear blurry.[34][35][36]

On September 9, 2015, with the release of the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were moved to the mid-range of the iPhone lineup. The 128 GB versions of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus was discontinued along with the gold version of both phones, but the 16 GB and 64 GB versions of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in silver and space gray remained available for sale at a reduced price.[37]

In June 2016, Apple faced a potential sales ban in China, as Shenzhen Baili, a Chinese device maker, alleged the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus infringed on its design patent.[38]

The iPhone 6 was temporary discontinued on September 7, 2016, and the 6 Plus was permanently discontinued on same date, when Apple announced the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, and the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus' spot as the entry-level iPhone was taken by the first-generation iPhone SE. As the iPhone SE has more powerful internal hardware than the midrange iPhone 6 (largely the same as the 6S) and had been released earlier on March 31, 2016, this created an unusual situation when it was sold alongside the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus until September 7 despite being marketed as a lower-tier iPhone.

In February 2017, the iPhone 6 was quietly relaunched in carrier stores and online, this time the storage has been changed to 32 GB. In India, it was sold on Amazon's website in Space Grey. In Taiwan, it was sold through Taiwan Mobile on March 10 in gold color. In mid-March, it was released in the EU to Belarus via the i-Store webshop. It also makes an appearance in North America with Sprint based US prepaid carriers Boost Mobile and Virgin Mobile, along with AT&T GoPhone. These are not being distributed by Apple on their website or their retail stores.


Specifications
--------------------------------------------------

Hardware
--------------------------------------------------

Design
--------------------------------------------------
The design of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus is influenced by that of the iPad Air with a glass front that is curved around the edges of the display, and an aluminum rear that contains two plastic strips for the antenna.[39] The back is built of 6000-series aluminum.[40] Both models come in gold, silver, and "space gray" finishes. The iPhone 6 has a thickness of 6.9 millimetres (0.27 in), while the iPhone 6 Plus is 7.1 mm (0.28 in) in thickness; both are thinner than the iPhone 5c and iPhone 5s, with the iPhone 6 being Apple's thinnest phone to date.


Displays
--------------------------------------------------
The most significant changes to the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are its displays; both branded as "Retina HD Display" and "ion-strengthened", the iPhone 6 display is 4.7 inches in size with a 16:9 resolution of 1334x750 (326 ppi, minus one row of pixels), while the iPhone 6 Plus includes a 5.5-inch 1920x1080 (1080p) display (401 PPI). The displays use a multiple-domain LCD panel, dubbed "dual-domain pixels"; the RGB pixels themselves are skewed in a pattern so every pixel is seen from a different angle. This technique helps improve the viewing angles of the display.[41]

To accommodate the larger physical size of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, the top button was renamed to "side button" and moved to the side of the phone instead of the top to improve its accessibility.[21][22]


Batteries
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 6 features a 6.91 Wh (1,810 mAh) battery, while the iPhone 6 Plus features an 11.1 Wh (2,915 mAh) battery, neither of which are user-replaceable.[citation needed]


Chipsets
--------------------------------------------------
Both models include an Apple A8 system-on-chip, and an M8 motion co-processor—an update of the M7 chip from the iPhone 5s. The primary difference between the M8 and the original M7 coprocessor is the M8 also includes a barometer to measure altitude changes. Phil Schiller said the A8 chip would provide, in comparison to the 5s, a 25% increase in CPU performance, a 50% increase in graphics performance, and less heat output. Early hands-on reports said the A8's GPU performance might indeed break away from previous generations doubling of performance at each yearly release, scoring 21204.26 in Base mark X compared to 20253.80, 10973.36 and 5034.75 on respectively the 5s, 5 and 4s.[42]


Connectivity
--------------------------------------------------
The expanded LTE connectivity on the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus is improved to LTE Advanced, with support for over 20 LTE bands (seven more than the iPhone 5s),[43] for up to 150 Mbit/s download speed, and VoLTE support. Wi-Fi performance has been improved with support for 802.11ac specifications, providing speeds up to 433.0581 Mbit/s—which is up to three times faster than 802.11n,[43] along with Wi-Fi Calling support where available. The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus adds support for near-field communications (NFC). It is initially used exclusively for Apple Pay—a new mobile payments system which allows users to store their credit cards in Passbook for use with online payments and retail purchases over NFC.[44][45] iOS 11 added limited use of near-field communications besides Apple Pay for 3rd party apps.[46]


Camera
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 6's rear-facing camera now has the ability to shoot 1080p Full HD video at either 30 or 60 frames per second and 720p HD slow-motion video at either 120 or 240 frames per second, while the iPhone 5s could only record at 30 and 120 frames per second respectively.[citation needed] Unlike the previous models, the rear-facing camera is not flush with the rear of the device, but instead protrudes slightly.[47]

Still photos can be captured during video recording. Those have a resolution of four megapixels (2720×1532).[48][49]

The camera also includes phase detection autofocus.[50] The iPhone 6 Plus camera is nearly identical, but also includes optical image stabilization.[21][22] The front-facing camera was also updated with a new sensor and f/2.2 aperture, along with support for burst and HDR modes.[21][22]

However, the optical image stabilization of the iPhone 6 Plus is only available for photography and deactivated during video recording.[14]

The front camera has 1.3 Megapixels and records video up to 720p at 30 frames per second.[12]


Sensors
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus are the first iPhones to be equipped with a barometer sensor.[51]

Like the predecessor, the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus are equipped with an accelerometer, gyroscope, front-facing proximity sensor and a digital compass.[12]


Software
--------------------------------------------------
When first released, the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus were supplied pre-loaded with iOS 8. Apps are able to take advantage of the increased screen size in the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus to display more information on-screen; for example, the Mail app uses a dual-pane layout similar to its iPad version when the device is in landscape mode on the iPhone 6 Plus. As it uses an identical aspect ratio, apps designed for the iPhone 5, iPhone 5c, and 5s can be upscaled for use on the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. To improve the usability of the devices' larger screens, an additional "Reachability" gesture was added; double-tapping the Home button will slide the top half of the screen's contents down to the bottom half of the screen. This function allows users to reach buttons located near the top of the screen, such as a "Back" button in the top-left corner.[21][22] Tapping it once resets the screen timeout so the user does not have to look at the screen for an empty spot to tap on.[52]

In June 2019, Apple announced that it would drop support for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus with the release of iOS 13.[53][54][55]


Reception
--------------------------------------------------
Both iPhone 6 models received positive reviews. Re/code called it "the best smartphone you can buy".[56] TechRadar praised the iPhone 6's "brilliant" design, improved battery life over the 5s, iOS 8 for being "smarter and more intuitive than ever", along with the quality of its camera. However, the plastic antenna strips on the rear of the phone were criticized for resulting in poor aesthetics, the display for having lower resolution and pixel density in comparison to other recent smartphones – including those with the same physical screen size as the iPhone 6, such as the HTC One, and for not having a sufficient justification for its significantly higher price in comparison to similar devices running Android or Windows Phone.[57] The Verge considered the iPhone 6 to be "simply and cleanly designed" in comparison to the 5s, noting the phone still felt usable despite its larger size, but criticized the antenna plastic, the protruding camera lens (which prevents the device from sitting flat without a case), and the lack of additional optimization in the operating system for the bigger screen. Improvements such as performance, battery life, VoLTE support, and other tweaks were also noted. In conclusion, the iPhone 6 was considered "good, even great, but there's little about it that's truly ambitious or truly moving the needle. It's just a refinement of a lot of existing ideas into a much more pleasant package".[39]

In regards to the 6 Plus, Engadget panned its design for being uncomfortable to hold and harder to grip in comparison to other devices such as the Galaxy Note 3 and LG G3, but praised its inclusion of optical image stabilization and slightly better battery life than the 6.[50]

The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus have been criticized by Forbes Magazine for the lack of 2160p (3840×2160 pixels) video recording due to the insufficient image sensor resolution of 3264×2448 pixels. However, third-party software is able to record footage at 3264×1836 pixels upscaled to 3840×2160p.[58]


Issues
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were affected by a number of notable hardware-related issues, including but not limited to concerns surrounding their rigidity (which led to incidents surrounding chassis bending, as well as degradation or outright loss of touchscreen functionality), performance issues on models with larger storage capacity, camera problems on the 6 Plus model, as well as an initially undocumented "error 53" that appeared under certain circumstances.




Bendgate (chassis bending)
--------------------------------------------------
Shortly after its public release, it was reported the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus chassis was susceptible to bending under pressure, such as when carried tightly in a user's pocket. While such issues are not exclusive to the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, the design flaw came to be known among users and the media as "Bendgate".[59][60]

Apple responded to the bending allegations, stating they had only received nine complaints of bent devices and that the damage occurring due to regular use is "extremely rare." The company maintained the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus went through durability testing to ensure they would stand up to daily use.[61] The company offered to replace phones that were bent if it is determined the bending was unintentional.[59]

In May 2018, as part of a lawsuit against Apple regarding touchscreen failure, it was revealed via internal documents that Apple knew the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus phones were more likely to bend than previous models. According to the court documents, Apple's internal tests found the iPhone 6 was 3.3 times more likely to bend than the iPhone 5s, while the larger iPhone 6 Plus was 7.2 times more likely to bend.[62][63]


Hair ripping
--------------------------------------------------
On October 3, 2014 9to5Mac released a post claiming certain iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus users complained on social networking sites the phone ripped off their hair when they held the phone close to their ears when making phone calls.[64] Twitter users claimed the seam between the glass screen and aluminum back of the iPhone 6 was to blame, with hair becoming caught within it.[65][66]


Flash storage performance
--------------------------------------------------
Some users reported the 64 and 128 GB iPhone 6 models had experienced performance issues, and that some 128 GB iPhone 6 Plus models would, in rare cases, randomly crash and reboot. Business Korea reported the issues were connected to the triple-level cell NAND storage of the affected models. Triple-level NAND flash can store three bits of data per cell of flash, and are cheaper than dual-level cell solutions, but at the cost of performance. It was reported Apple had planned to switch the affected model lines back to multi-level cell flash, and address the performance issues on existing devices in a future iOS update.[67][68][69]


iPhone 6/6 Plus camera issues
--------------------------------------------------
It was reported the optical image stabilization systems on some iPhone 6 Plus models were faulty, failing to properly stabilize when the phone is being held perfectly still, leading to blurry photos and "wavy"-looking videos.[70] The optical image stabilization system was also found to have been affected by accessories that use magnets, such as third-party lens attachments; Apple issued advisories to users and its licensed accessory makers, warning magnetic or metallic accessories can cause the OIS to malfunction.[71]

On August 21, 2015, Apple instituted a repair program for iPhone 6 Plus models released between September 2014 and January 2015, citing faulty rear cameras on affected models may produce blurry pictures.[34][35][36]

Some iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus models have an issue in which the front-facing camera is somehow "shifted", or out of place. Apple stated they would replace most affected iPhone 6 models with this issue, free of charge. Despite numerous complaints regarding this issue, it does not seem to affect the camera itself. It is said the camera is not what has shifted, but a piece of protective foam around the camera module itself that has gone out of place.[72]


"Error 53"
--------------------------------------------------
If the iPhone 6 home button is repaired or modified by a third party, the device will fail security checks related to Touch ID as the components have not been "re-validated" for security reasons—a process that can only be performed by an authorized Apple outlet. Failing these checks disables all features related to Touch ID. Such effects have sometimes happened as a result of damage as well.[73][74]

It was reported these same hardware integrity checks would trigger an unrecoverable loop into "Recovery Mode" if iOS is updated or restored, with attempts to restore the device via iTunes software resulting in an "error 53" message. Beyond the explanation this is related to hardware integrity errors regarding Touch ID components, Apple provided no official explanation of what specifically triggers error 53 or how it can be fixed without replacing the entire device.[73][74]

On February 18, 2016, Apple released an iOS 9.2.1 patch through iTunes which addresses this issue and admitted error 53 was actually related to a diagnostic check for inspecting the Touch ID hardware before an iPhone is shipped from its factories.[75]


Touchscreen failure ("touch disease")
--------------------------------------------------
Touchscreen control components on iPhone 6 logic boards have insufficient support, including a lack of underfill—which strengthens and stabilizes integrated circuits, and a lack of rigid metal shielding on the logic board unlike previous iPhone models; the touchscreen controller is instead shielded by a flexible "sticker". Normal use of the device can cause the logic board to flex internally, which strains the touchscreen IC connectors and leads to a degradation or outright loss of touchscreen functionality. A symptom that has been associated with this type of failure is a flickering grey bar near the top of the display.[76][77] iFixit reported this issue, nicknamed "touch disease",[76][78][79] was a byproduct of the previous "Bendgate" design flaw because of the device's demonstrated lack of rigidity. As such, the larger iPhone 6 Plus is more susceptible to the flaw, but it has also been reported on a small percentage of iPhone 6 models.[79][80][81] The devices' successor, the iPhone 6s, is not afflicted by this flaw due to changes to their internal design, which included the strengthening of "key points" in the rear casing, and the re-location of the touchscreen controllers to the display assembly from the logic board.[80]

Initially, Apple did not officially acknowledge this issue. The issue was widely discussed on Apple's support forum—where posts discussing the issue have been subject to censorship.[77] The touchscreen can be repaired via microsoldering: Apple Stores are not equipped with the tools needed to perform the logic board repair, which had led to affected users sending their devices to unofficial, third-party repair services. An Apple Store employee interviewed by Apple Insider reported six months after they first started noticing the problem, Apple had issued guidance instructing them to tell affected users this was a hardware issue that could not be repaired and that their iPhone had to be replaced. However, some in-stock units have also been afflicted with this issue out of the box, leading to an employee stating they were "tired of pulling service stock out of the box, and seeing the exact same problem the customer has on the replacement".[81][82] The issue received mainstream attention in August 2016 when reported by iFixit.[76][79][81] On August 26, 2016, Apple Insider reported based on data from four "high-traffic" Apple Store locations, there was a spike in the number of iPhone 6 devices brought into them for repairs following mainstream reports of the "touch disease" problem.[82]

On August 30, 2016, a group of three iPhone 6 owners sued Apple Inc. in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California and filed for a proposed class action lawsuit, alleging Apple was engaging in unfair business practices by having "long been aware" of the defective design, yet refusing to acknowledge or repair it.[78][83][84]

On November 17, 2016, Apple officially acknowledged the issue and announced a paid repair program for affected iPhone 6 Plus models, stating; "some iPhone 6 Plus devices may exhibit display flickering or Multi-Touch issues after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device".[85]


Sales
--------------------------------------------------
Apple Inc. announced, within 24 hours of availability, over 4 million pre-orders of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were made, exceeding the supply available—an Apple record.[86] 10 million iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus devices were sold in the first three days, marking another Apple record. The iPhone 6S & 6S Plus were introduced in September 2015 selling 13 million units which set the record for sales in the first three days from last years release.[87] Three months after its release, the iPhone 6 generated 71.5 million unit sales.[88]

As of June 2017, the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus have sold 222.4 million units worldwide, making them the most popular iPhone models and the best-selling smartphones of all time.[89][88]

List of iPhone models

The iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus are smartphones developed and marketed by Apple Inc. They are the eleventh generation of the iPhone. The iPhone 8 was released on September 22, 2017, succeeding the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, respectively.[9]

The designs of the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus are largely similar to that of their predecessors except for the addition of a glass back. The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus were the final flagship iPhone models to feature the home button and Touch ID. Notable changes include the removal of the rose gold and jet black color variants,[10] addition of inductive charging, a faster processor, and improved cameras and displays. The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus share most of their internal hardware with the iPhone X.

The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus were discontinued as of February 2020, having sold 86.3 million units worldwide, making them one of the best-selling smartphones of all time.[11][12][original research?] They initially shipped with iOS 11 and supported up to iOS 16, and do not support iOS 17.[13]

The second and third generations of the entry level iPhone SE retain the iPhone 8's exterior dimensions and Touch ID, with upgraded hardware.


History
--------------------------------------------------
Apple invited the press to a media event at the Steve Jobs Theater in the Apple Park campus on September 12, 2017.[14] The iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus were announced at that event, and released on September 22, 2017.[15]

On April 9, 2018, Apple introduced an iPhone 8 with a red color finish and a black front, in support of their partnership with Product Red and their AIDS fundraising campaign.[16]

In November 2018, just over a year from initial release, Apple started selling refurbished iPhone 8 models starting at $499.[17] The price was lowered to US$319.[18] Refurbished iPhone 8 Plus models were available starting at $599.[19] The price was also subsequently lowered to US$469 and later to $359.[20]

On April 15, 2020, Apple announced the second-generation iPhone SE and discontinued the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, which share the external form factor but has upgraded internals including an A13 Bionic processor.[21][22] On March 8, 2022, Apple announced the third-generation iPhone SE with the same exterior dimensions, but with an upgraded camera and Apple's A15 processor.


Specifications
--------------------------------------------------

Hardware
--------------------------------------------------

Display
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus retain the Retina HD Display found in the iPhone 7,[23] but they now feature True Tone technology, allowing for automatic screen adjustments based on surrounding ambient lighting.[15] They can play HDR10 and Dolby Vision content despite not having an HDR-ready display, done by down-converting the HDR content to fit the display while still having some enhancements to dynamic range, contrast, and wide color gamut compared to standard content.[24]


Camera
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus feature a 12 MP camera with autofocus, f/1.8 aperture and optical image stabilization capable of capturing 4K video at 24, 30, or 60 frames per second, or 1080p video at 30, 60, 120 or 240 frames per second,[25] and a Quad LED True Tone Flash with Slow Sync.[26] The Slow Sync flash, 4K 60fps, and 1080p 240 fps options are new features for the 8 and 8 Plus, over the options available on the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus.

The iPhone 8 Plus, like the iPhone 7 Plus, adds a second, telephoto, lens. A new AI-driven option is available for the iPhone 8 Plus, called Portrait Lighting--making use of the more capable image signal processor in the A11 SoC.[26]

Both models have a 7 MP front camera with an f/2.2 aperture capable of capturing 1080p video at 30 frames per second and 720p video at 24 frames per second, along with face detection and high-dynamic range.[25][27]

The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus record videos with single channel audio (mono).[28]

Still photos with 6.5 megapixels (3412×1920) can be captured during video recording.[29]


Chipset
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus contain the Apple A11 Bionic system-on-chip, a hexa-core processor that the company says features two performance cores that are 25% faster than those found in the iPhone 7's A10 processor and four efficiency cores that are 70% faster than those in the prior model. The phones also feature an Apple-designed graphics processing unit 30% faster than prior units, with the same level of performance as the A10 at half the power.[15]


Other
--------------------------------------------------
The phones have glass backs instead of the complete aluminum housing found on prior models, enabling the use of Qi inductive charging.[15] The phones are rated IP67 for water resistance and dust resistance. [30] Both models come with 64, 128, and 256 gigabytes storage options,[31][32] and are offered in silver, gold, or Space Gray color options.[15] A Product Red special edition version in red with a black front was released on April 9, 2018.[16] The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus were the last iPhones with white front in Silver and Gold colors.

In addition to Qi wireless charging, the iPhone 8 also supports wired charging using Apple's proprietary Lightning connector. It can fast-charge from a charger providing USB Power Delivery combined with a special USB-C to Lightning adapter cable supporting fast charging.[33]

The iPhone 8 has a 6 out of 10 reparability score from iFixit, mainly due to the use of excessive glue for the back glass.[34]


Software
--------------------------------------------------
Both the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus were supplied with iOS 11 on launch,[25][27] and support iOS 12, iOS 13, iOS 14, iOS 15 and iOS 16. Apple announced that the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, as well as the iPhone X, would not support iOS 17 due to hardware limitations.[35] However, the devices still receive security updates.


Reception
--------------------------------------------------
Reception of the phones was generally positive, with reviewers praising the addition of inductive charging, fast charge capability, and the new Apple A11 processor, while criticizing the aging design that was introduced with the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in 2014.

Samuel Axon of Ars Technica called the A11 processor "a marvelous feat of engineering", writing that it offers "industry-leading performance". Axon also praised the cameras, writing that "The colors are great, and low light performance is very good for a smartphone".[36] Chris Velazco of Engadget praised the speed of the A11 processor, the build quality and the "excellent" camera, while criticizing design familiarities with previous iPhone generations and limited water-protection levels compared to competitors.[37]

John McCann of TechRadar enjoyed the feel of the glass back despite criticizing the phone's overall design. McCann also praised the camera and called inductive charging a "useful" addition to the iPhone lineup.[38]

David Pierce of Wired similarly stated that the iPhone 8 models were overshadowed by the iPhone X, despite calling them "virtually perfect phones". Pierce praised performance, cameras, and displays, while repeatedly criticizing the "outdated" design.[39]

Nilay Patel of The Verge called the iPhone 8 the "default option", noting that the 8 models stand as almost universally overlooked by Apple's other new iPhone launched, the iPhone X. He nevertheless praised the device's form factor for being easy and non-slippery to hold and the display's addition of True Tone technology and upgraded speakers, though he cited issues with inductive charging speed through wireless pads as well as the price of the iPhone 8 Plus 256 GB, which was close to that of the iPhone X. Patel also criticized the iPhone 8's aging design, dating back to the iPhone 6 released in 2014; the most notable critique was of the thick bezels when compared to other 2017 smartphones, designed with nearly bezel-less faces to incorporate larger screens in a similar form factor.[40]

The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus were also criticized for their durability, as drop tests performed showed that the rear glass is not "the most durable glass ever in a smartphone", as claimed by Apple.[41][42]

Camera testing company DxOMark gave the camera on the iPhone 8 a rating of 92 and 8 Plus a rating of 94, giving them the title of best smartphone cameras tested by the company.[43][44] The Samsung Galaxy Note 8 later matched the iPhone 8 Plus with an identical overall score of 94.[45][46] They were later overtaken by the Google Pixel 2, which scored a 98 rating.[47]

Although being the first mobile phone to record 2160p at 60 frames per second, the iPhone 8, 8 Plus and X have been criticized in a review by GSMArena for its mono (single-channel) audio recording for videos, while stereo audio recording for videos has been available on competing mobile phone models for several years, such as the Samsung Galaxy S3 and Sony Xperia S from 2012.[28][48][49]


Issues
--------------------------------------------------
On August 31, 2018, Apple announced that a "very small percentage" of iPhone 8 devices released between September 2017 and March 2018 contained a manufacturing defect in the logic board. This fault affected iPhone 8 models sold in Australia, China, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Macau, New Zealand, and the United States. Defective devices may experience unexpected reboots, a frozen or unresponsive screen, or may fail to turn on. Users with an affected device, as determined by their serial number, can have their device replaced for free by Apple. This issue does not affect the iPhone 8 Plus.[50][51]

List of iPhone models

The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are smartphones developed and marketed by Apple. They are the seventeenth generation of iPhones, succeeding the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus. The devices were announced on September 12, 2023, during the Apple Event at Apple Park in Cupertino, California alongside the higher-priced iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max. Pre-orders began on September 15, 2023, and the devices were made available on September 22, 2023. Like the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, the 15 and 15 Plus are the first iPhones to replace the proprietary Lightning connector with USB-C to comply with European Union mandates.


History
--------------------------------------------------
In September 2021, the European Commission began considering a proposal to mandate USB-C on all devices in the European Union, including iPhones.[10] Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo claimed that Apple would drop its proprietary Lightning connector by 2023. At the time of those claims, Apple was considering switching to USB-C due to the likelihood that the EU proposal would pass.[11] The proposal was passed into law in October 2022, becoming the Radio Equipment Directive. Apple confirmed it would comply with the regulations later that month.[12]

Two weeks prior to the formal introduction of the iPhone 15, it was announced that some of the devices which were made in India would for the first time be sold around the world on the launch day.[13]


Design
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 15 is the first major redesign since the iPhone 12, featuring rounder edges and a slightly curved display, and back glass. Both models are available in five colors: blue, pink, yellow, green and black.[1] This makes it the first entry level iPhone since the iPhone XR to not ship with a Product Red variant at launch.

The iPhone 15 features a 6.1-inch (155 mm) display with Super Retina XDR OLED technology at a resolution of 2556×1179 pixels and a pixel density of about 460 PPI with a refresh rate of 60 Hz. The iPhone 15 Plus features a 6.7-inch (170 mm) display with the same technology at a resolution of 2796×1290 pixels and a pixel density of about 460 PPI. Both models have an improved typical brightness of up to 1,000 nits, a peak HDR brightness of up to 1,600 nits, and a peak outdoor brightness of up to 2,000 nits.[9] The Dynamic Island feature, previously exclusive to iPhone 14 Pro, is now standard on iPhone 15, replacing the notch that was introduced in the iPhone X.[14]


Charging and transfer speeds
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus use USB-C with USB 2.0 transfer speeds (up to 480 Mb/s or 60 MB/s),[15] compared to the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max which have faster USB 3.2 Gen 2 transfer speeds (up to 10 Gb/s or 1.25 GB/s).[16] The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus, as well as the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, are the first iPhone models to use USB-C, as well as the first iPhones since the iPhone 5 to switch to a new charging port.


Video output
--------------------------------------------------
All iPhone 15 models have support for DisplayPort Alternate Mode over USB-C video output with HDR up to 4K resolution.[9]

Previous iPhone models (from iPhone 5 until iPhone 14) had a maximum supported resolution of 1600 x 900 (slightly less than 1080p) with the Lightning Digital AV Adapter due to technical constraints of the Lightning connector.[17]


Battery
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 15 Plus offers users up to 26 hours of video playback and up to 100 hours of audio playback, and the iPhone 15 offers significantly less, with up to 20 hours of video playback and up to 80 hours of audio playback.[18]


Software
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus launched with iOS 17 and is compatible with iOS 18.[19][20][21] Consistent with the UK Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure regulation, it will continue to receive major software updates for a minimum of five years to at least 2028.[22]

Criticism
--------------------------------------------------

Overheating
--------------------------------------------------
Some owners claimed that their iPhone 15s were experiencing overheating issues,[26] reportedly reaching temperatures as high as 47 °C (117 °F).[27] Apple later stated that there were several reasons why the phones heat up, mainly hinting at a software issue.[28] It was stated that it would be fixed with an update to iOS 17.0.3.[29] The overheating issues were reported to persist after the update.[30]

List of iPhone models

The iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus are smartphones developed and marketed by Apple. They are the eighteenth-generation iPhones, succeeding the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus, and those phones succeed the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus. The devices were unveiled alongside the higher-priced iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max during the September 9, 2024 Apple Event at Apple Park in Cupertino, California.[3] These lower-end phones come with the software update iOS 18, with more updates to come later in the future.


History
--------------------------------------------------
When Apple announced in "It's Glowtime" Event, The SiP chip of the lower-priced iPhone 16 lineup have skipped from the Apple A17 Pro (used in the iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max and iPad Mini 7th generation) to the regular Apple A18 (a low-entry variant 5-core GPU successor to the Apple A16 Bionic used in the iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 14 Pro Max, iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus) which this SiP is the first Apple A-series SiP in the iPhone to come with the two variants including the low-entry Apple A18 (a 5-core GPU variant, used in the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus) and the high-end Apple A18 Pro (a 6-core GPU variant, used in the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max).

The devices were unveiled during an event on September 9, 2024, marking the first time an iPhone release had been announced on a Monday.[4] It is also the first iPhone to not come included with Apple stickers, as Apple removed it for "environmental reasons", but the stickers can be included if a customer asks for it at an Apple Store.[5]


Design
--------------------------------------------------
Like the iPhone 15, the device features rounded edges, a slightly curved display, and back glass.


Display
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus retain their screen sizes of 6.1 inches and 6.7 inches, respectively. They feature a full-edge screen design with slim borders.


Camera
--------------------------------------------------
iPhone 16 features a more refined dual-lens array on the back, with a 48 megapixel Fusion wide-angle lens and 12 megapixel ultra-wide lens. The cameras are now aligned vertically, similar to iPhone 12, instead of diagonally like on iPhone 15, enabling spatial video capture.

There is also an improved Photographic Styles feature for real-time lighting and color adjustments, allowing specific tones and colors to be manipulated. [6]


Colors
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 16 and 16 Plus come in five colors: ultramarine, teal, pink, white and black.[7]


Hardware
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 16 and the iPhone 16 Plus use an Apple A18 system on a chip. The chip is optimized for running Generative artificial intelligence and features a Neural Engine that is twice as fast as its predecessor.

The iPhone 16 includes an updated 48-megapixel Fusion camera, the same resolution as the iPhone 15, with 2 μm, quad pixel PDAF, sensor-shift OIS, 100% Focus Pixels, support for super-high-resolution photos (24MP and 48MP). It has a new ultrawide camera with a wider aperture, automatic focus and 1.4 μm, 100% Focus Pixels.[8]

All ‌iPhone 16‌ models have an improved thermal design. The main logic board has been updated, centralizing chip placement and optimizing the surrounding architecture. The recycled aluminum substructure dissipates heat for up to 30 percent higher sustained performance for gaming.[9]

Every model in the iPhone 16 lineup has support for WiFi 7.[10]


Action Button
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus come with the Action Button, first featured on the iPhone 15 Pro lineup. By default, the Action Button toggles silent mode. However, users can change the button's feature to do different things other than silent mode, like open the Camera app or toggle a focus mode.


Camera Control button
--------------------------------------------------
All iPhone 16 models now come with a new button called Camera Control. This button is on the right side of the device, and allows the user to open the camera app, switch between different camera controls and features, and taking photos and videos. The button can distinguish between light and hard presses. By pressing the button once, it opens the camera app. By lightly pressing it twice, it opens a small menu with different camera controls, such as zoom or tone. Pressing the button hard once takes a photo, while holding for a few seconds starts a video. [11]


Battery and charging
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 16 has been upgraded in terms of battery capacity.[12]

The base iPhone 16 has video playback duration of up to 22 hours, while the iPhone 16 Plus has video playback up to 27 hours. The iPhone 16 has duration of audio playback up to 80 hours, 20% less than the iPhone 16 Plus with 100 hours of audio playback. The MagSafe wireless charging standard has been refreshed with a longer cable as an option, allowing the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus to charge at a faster speed of 25W with a 30W power adapter.


Enclosure
--------------------------------------------------
The enclosure is made up of 85% recycled content.[8]


Software
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 16 launched with iOS 18. While the device was announced alongside Apple Intelligence, these features were delayed until after release.[13]

iOS 18 includes RecoveryOS on the iPhone 16 series that allows users to recover and restore firmware wirelessly using another iPhone.[14]


Specifications
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 16 and 16 Plus have a vertical camera layout, similar to the iPhone 12, as opposed to the diagonal layout for iPhone 13, iPhone 14, and iPhone 15. USB Type-C port is used, albeit with USB 2.0 data transfer speeds up to 480 Mb/s.[15]


Price
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 16 has a starting price of US$799, while the iPhone 16 Plus starts at US$899. Pre-orders began on September 13, 2024, and sales started September 20.[16]


Criticism
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 16 has received positive feedback for several aspects, but also shows a few limitations. The upgraded design is a favourite, bringing a refreshed aesthetic with the available vibrant colour options, which feel more dynamic than past models. The display maintains Apple’ Super Retina HDR quality, but is limited to a 60Hz refresh rate, which some users find outdated compared to faster displays on cheaper competitor phones.[17][18]

List of iPhone models

The iPhone 4 is a smartphone that was developed and marketed by Apple Inc. It is the fourth generation of the iPhone lineup, succeeding the iPhone 3GS and preceding the iPhone 4s. Following a number of notable leaks, the iPhone 4 was first unveiled on June 7, 2010, at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco,[7] and was released on June 24, 2010, in the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Japan.

The iPhone 4 introduced a new hardware design to the iPhone family, which Apple's CEO Steve Jobs touted as the thinnest smartphone in the world at the time; it consisted of a stainless steel frame which doubled as an antenna, with internal components situated between two panels of aluminosilicate glass.[8] The iPhone 4 introduced Apple's new high-resolution "Retina display" (with a pixel density of 326 pixels per inch), while maintaining the same physical size and aspect ratio as its precursors, Apple's A4 system-on-chip, along with iOS 4—which notably introduced multitasking functionality and app folders. It was the first iPhone at the time to include a front-facing camera, which made possible Apple's new FaceTime video chat service, and the first to be released in a version for CDMA networks, ending AT&T's period as the exclusive carrier of iPhone products in the United States.

The iPhone 4 received a largely positive reception, with critics praising its revamped design and more powerful hardware, in comparison to previous models. While it was a market success (with over 600,000 pre-orders within 24 hours), the release of the iPhone 4 was plagued by highly publicized reports concerning abnormalities in its new antenna design that caused the device to lose its cellular signal if held in a certain way. Most direct contact with the phone's outer edge would cause a significant decrease in signal strength. Apple released iOS 4.0.1 to try to fix these issues, but were unsuccessful.[9]

The iPhone 4 spent the longest time as Apple's flagship iPhone model at fifteen months. Although the succeeding 4S was announced in October 2011, the 4 continued to be sold as a midrange model until September 2012, and thereafter as the entry-level offering in Apple's lineup until September 2013 with the announcement of the iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c. The iPhone 4 had one of the longest lifespans of any iPhone ever produced, spanning close to four years and available in some developing countries until early 2015.


History
--------------------------------------------------

Prototypes
--------------------------------------------------
Before the official unveiling of the iPhone 4 on June 7, 2010, two prototypes were brought to the attention of the media, breaching Apple's normally secretive development process. Many of the speculations regarding technical specifications proved accurate.


Engadget leak
--------------------------------------------------
On January 27, 2010, gadget website Engadget received leaked images of the unreleased first-generation iPad.[10] Unbeknownst to the editors and readers, these images contained two unreleased iPhone 4 models.[11] It wasn't until the subsequent Gizmodo release that they were aware of the complete contents of the images.[12]


Gizmodo leak
--------------------------------------------------
On April 19, 2010, gadget website Gizmodo reported that they had purchased an iPhone prototype for $5000, and furthermore, had conducted a product teardown of the device. The prototype was reported to have been lost by an Apple employee, Gray Powell, in Redwood City, California.[13] Shortly after Gizmodo published detailed information about the prototype, Apple's legal associates formally requested for the phone to be returned to Apple, and Gizmodo responded with the intent to cooperate.[14]

On April 23, officers from the Rapid Enforcement Allied Computer Team (REACT) task force of the California HTTAP Program raided the home of Jason Chen, the Gizmodo editor responsible for reviewing the prototype, seizing all of his computers and hard drives.[15] The Electronic Frontier Foundation criticized the raid as violating journalist source protection laws that forbid the seizure of journalist computers, as well as the suspicion that Apple had used its influence as a member of the steering committee, which is charged with direction and oversight of the California REACT task force to push police into action in a way that would not normally be conducted for this type of incident. Apple had already received the iPhone prototype before the raid when it was returned by Gizmodo.[16] The District Attorney stated that the investigation was suspended, and discontinued searching through the Gizmodo editor's belongings as they determine whether the shield laws are applicable, and cautioned that no charges have been issued at this point.[17][18]


Taoviet leak
--------------------------------------------------
Pictures and video of a second prototype were published on a Vietnamese website, Taoviet, on May 12, 2010.[19] It was almost identical to the first, and used an A4 chip manufactured by Apple.[20] The website purchased the prototype for $4,000.[21] DigiTimes reported that the screen resolution of the new phone was 960-by-640, which was confirmed by Apple at the iPhone 4's official announcement.


Release
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 4 was available for pre-order on June 15, 2010.[22] Customers attempting to pre-order the iPhone 4 reported problems with the pre-order process on the US and UK online Apple Stores which crashed due to the surge in traffic.[23] The same issue was reported with AT&T and SoftBank, Apple's exclusive partners in the United States and Japan respectively, who suspended advance sales of the iPhone 4 as demand threatened to exceed supply.[24] Retail stores were also unable to complete pre-order transactions due to the servers crashing.[25]

Apple and its partner carriers received 600,000 pre-orders for the iPhone 4 in the first 24 hours, the largest number of pre-orders Apple had received in a single day for any device up to that point.[26] Engadget reported that at 20:30 UTC, all iPhone 4 pre-order suppliers had sold out.[27] 1.7 million iPhone 4 models were sold in its first three days of availability.[28]

The iPhone 4 was also released through Orange in Tunisia and was available in eight cities at the launch.[29] On July 30, 2010, iPhone 4 was made available for sale in Australia, New Zealand and 15 other countries with free bumper cases.[30][31] In South Korea, it was released by KT on September 10. In Israel, it was released, too, on September 24, through Cellcom, Pelephone and Orange. It was launched in Thailand on September 23 by AIS, DTAC and True Move, and in Malaysia on September 26 in Kuala Lumpur, and nationwide on September 27 according to the Malaysian service provider Maxis.

The iPhone 4 was released in South Africa on September 22 on the Vodacom and MTN networks, in very limited quantities.[32] The iPhone 4 was launched in Vietnam on September 30 on VinaPhone and Viettel, at first in three major cities: Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City and Da Nang, and then all over the country by the end of October.

The iPhone 4 was launched in India on May 27, 2011 by Aircel and Airtel.[33]

On January 11, 2011, Verizon Wireless announced during a media event that it had reached an agreement with Apple and would begin selling a CDMA iPhone 4 in the United States, ending Apple's exclusivity agreement with AT&T. The Verizon iPhone went on sale on February 10 and pre orders began on February 3.[34][35][36] The Verizon iPhone includes the 'Personal Hotspot" feature which allows a user to use the iPhone as a wireless hotspot, with up to five devices connecting at one time. The February 3, 2011, presale of the iPhone 4 broke Verizon's first day sales records for a single device.[37]

On June 24, 2010, Apple stated that the white iPhone 4 models were proving more "challenging to manufacture" than expected, and initially pushed the release date back to the second half of July.[38] There was a lot of speculation surrounding the delay of the white iPhone 4. Among the most popular rumours are those concerning the phone's internal camera being adversely affected by light leaking in due to the semi-translucent glass and the white paint.[39][40] Other sources report that the problem relates to Apple's inability to match the white colour of the front faceplate with that of the home button.[41] On April 27, 2011, Apple announced that it would be releasing the white iPhone 4 model on April 28, 2011, for both GSM and CDMA.[42] The release of the white iPhone 4 was carried out on April 28.[43][44]

During Apple's official unveiling of the iPhone 4s on October 4, 2011, it was announced that Sprint would begin carrying the CDMA iPhone 4 and the iPhone 4s in the US on October 14.[45][46]


Discontinuation
--------------------------------------------------
In September 2013, after the release of the iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c, Apple stopped selling the iPhone 4 in most of their stores as well as on their website. It was replaced by the 8 GB iPhone 4s.[47][48][49]


Hardware
--------------------------------------------------

Display
--------------------------------------------------
The display of the iPhone 4 was manufactured by LG under an exclusive contract with Apple. It features an LED backlit TFT LCD capacitive touchscreen with a pixel density of 326 pixels per inch (ppi) on a 3.5 in (8.9 cm) (diagonally measured), 960×640 display. Each pixel is 78 micrometers in width. The display has a contrast ratio of 800:1. The screen was marketed by Apple as the "Retina display", based on the assertion that a display of approximately 300 ppi at a distance of 305 millimetres (12 in) from one's eye, or 57 arcseconds per pixel,[50] is the maximum amount of detail that the human retina can perceive.[51] With the iPhone expected to be used at a distance of about 12 inches from the eyes, a higher resolution would allegedly have no effect on the image's apparent quality as the maximum potential of the human eye has already been met.

This claim was widely disputed. Raymond Soneira, president of DisplayMate Technologies, said in an interview with the Wired magazine, that his claims by Jobs are something of an exaggeration: "It is reasonably close to being a perfect display, but Steve pushed it a little too far". Soneira stated that the resolution of the human retina is higher than claimed by Apple, working out to 477 PPI at 12 inches (305 mm) from the eyes, or 36 arcseconds per pixel.[52]

However, Phil Plait, author of Bad Astronomy, whose career includes a collaboration with NASA regarding the camera on the Hubble Space Telescope, responded to the criticism by stating that "if you have [better than 20/20] eyesight, then at one foot away the iPhone 4's pixels are resolved. The picture will look pixellated. If you have average eyesight, the picture will look just fine".[53][54]


Camera
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 4 features an additional front-facing 640x480 camera, and a backside-illuminated 5 megapixel rear-facing camera with a 3.85 mm f/2.8 lens[55][1] and an LED flash. The rear-facing 5-megapixel camera is capable of recording HD video in 720p at 30 frames per second. Both cameras make use of the tap to focus feature, part of iOS 4, for photo and video recording.[56] The rear-facing camera has a 5× digital zoom.


Connectivity
--------------------------------------------------
In contrast to Steve Jobs' announcement at WWDC 2010, Federal Communications Commission documentation showed that, in fact, the iPhone 4 contains a penta-band 3G UMTS antenna, not a quad-band 3G UMTS radio, as advertised by Apple [citation needed]. According to the FCC documentation filed by Apple, the radio inside the iPhone 4 supports 800, 850, 900, 1,900, and 2,100 MHz. The 800 MHz frequency, which is most commonly used in Japanese mobile phones, is not advertised as being supported by Apple.[57] However, the 800 MHz band is a subset of the 850 MHz band, which probably explains why the device was advertised as quad-band.[citation needed] The chip-sets were manufactured by Skyworks Solutions[58] and Infineon for GSM version.

As with most of Apple's mobile products at the time, the iPhone 4 also used the 30 pin dock connector as its only external data port.

The iPhone 4 is the first generation of iPhone to have a second microphone used for noise cancellation. It is located on the top of the unit near the headphone jack; the main microphone is on the bottom left.[59]


Gyroscope and accelerometer
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 4 introduces a gyroscopic sensor that detects 3-axis angular acceleration around the X, Y, and Z axes, enabling precise calculation of yaw, pitch, and roll. The gyroscope complements the accelerometer, a sensor that has been present since the original iPhone, which detects the device's acceleration, shake, vibration shock, or fall by detecting linear acceleration along with one of three axes (X, Y, and Z). The combined data from the accelerometer and the gyroscope provides detailed and precise information about the device's 6-axis movement in space. The 3 axes of the gyroscope combined with the 3 axes of the accelerometer enable the device to recognize approximately how far, fast, and in which direction it has moved in space.[60]


Processor, memory and storage
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 4 is powered by the Apple A4 chip, which was designed by Intrinsity[61] and, like all prior iPhone models, manufactured by Samsung.[62] This system-on-a-chip is composed of an ARM Cortex-A8 CPU integrated with a PowerVR SGX535 GPU.[63] The Apple A4 was also used in the first-generation iPad (released in 2010), where it was clocked at its rated speed of 1 GHz. The Apple A4 was the first ever mobile phone processor designed by Apple. The clock speed in the iPhone 4 was never disclosed. All prior models of the iPhone had underclocked the CPU, which typically extends battery life and lowers heat dissipation.

The iPhone 4 has 512 MB of DRAM. The additional DRAM supports increased performance and multi-tasking.[64] As on prior models, all data is stored in flash memory, 8, 16 or 32 GB, and not on the SIM. Unlike prior generations, the storage capacity is not printed on the back of the unit.


Micro-SIM
--------------------------------------------------
The GSM iPhone 4 uses a micro-SIM card, which is positioned in an ejectable tray, located on the right side of the device. The CDMA iPhone 4, however, the phone connects to the network using an ESN. All prior models have used regular mini-SIM cards. Depending on the operator, micro-SIM cards may not be available for all networks globally. As a technical workaround, it is possible to trim a mini-SIM card with a knife or scissors so that it fits into the micro-SIM tray.[65]


Design
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 4 features a redesigned structure, designed by Jony Ive, a design that would later be reused and adapted for the iPhone 4S, 5, 5S and first-generation iPhone SE. Most notably, the bulges of the back panel as well as the band between the front and back are gone and have been replaced with flattened surfaces. The redesign reflects the utilitarianism and uniformity of existing Apple products, such as the iPad and the iMac. The overall dimensions of the iPhone 4 have been reduced from their predecessor.[66]

It is 115 millimetres (4.5 in) high, 58.6 millimetres (2.31 in) wide, and 9.4 millimetres (0.37 in) deep, compared to the iPhone 3GS, which is 116 millimetres (4.6 in) high, 62 millimetres (2.4 in) wide, and 12 millimetres (0.47 in) deep; making the iPhone 4 24% thinner than its predecessor, the iPhone 3GS. Steve Jobs claimed it to be "the thinnest smartphone on the planet."[66] The reduced size of the device is primarily due to the externally placed antenna.

The iPhone 4 is structured around a stainless steel frame that wraps around the edge of the phone, acting both as the primary structure for the device and as the iPhone 4's antennas. This metal band features two slits on the GSM version of the phone, one at the lower left, and one at the top (and a fake slit along the lower right, to cosmetically mirror the one at the lower left) that divide the band into two antenna sections: the left section of the band serves as the Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and GPS antenna, and the right and lower sections of the band act as the antenna for GSM and UMTS connectivity.

On the CDMA version of the phone, there are four slits in the metal band. Two at the top (on the left and right) and two at the bottom. This divides the metal band into four different segments, which like the GSM version of the phone, serve as different antennas for connectivity. The top portion of the band (divided by the top left and right slits) is for connecting to the CDMA network. The left portion of the metal band is for Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and GPS just like the GSM version. The right side is not an antenna but serves to cosmetically mirror the left side and also to create a similar look to the GSM version of the phone.

The internal components are situated between two panels of aluminosilicate glass, described by Apple as being "chemically strengthened to be 20 times stiffer and 30 times harder than plastic," theoretically allowing it to be more scratch-resistant and durable than the prior models.[8]

In fall 2010, pentalobe screws started to replace the Philips screws used in post-repair units in the US and in production units in Japan.[67]


Software
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 4 shipped with iOS 4, which was the newest version of Apple's iOS mobile operating system at the time. iOS 4 introduced a multitasking system, allowing apps to remain "suspended" in memory, perform certain operations in the background, and allowing users to switch between apps using an on-screen menu.[68] It also introduced FaceTime, which allows users to perform video calls between other iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, and Mac OS X users.

The iPhone 4 supports up to iOS 7, released in September 2013. Due to the relatively aged hardware of the iPhone 4, most features available on newer iPhone models are not available on the device; as of iOS 7, they include Siri, 3D maps and turn-by-turn navigation, AirDrop, AirPlay mirroring, live camera filters, panorama mode and certain visual effects introduced by iOS 7, such as the blurring of translucent interface elements, the parallax effect on the home screen, and live wallpapers.[69] While still subject to the same limitations, iOS 7.1 did bring some slight performance improvements to the operating system on the iPhone 4. iOS 7, specifically iOS 7.1.2, is the last version of iOS to support the iPhone 4. Unlike the iPhone 4s, the iPhone 4 did not receive the iOS 8 update due to performance issues.[70][71]


Accessories
--------------------------------------------------

Bumper
--------------------------------------------------
Apple released a plastic and rubber case called the Bumper to protect the edges of the phone. The case, which also provided some screen protection, included buttons and holes that enabled switch and connector access.[72]

Apple updated the bumper with a wider volume switch hole with the release of the iPhone 4 for CDMA networks. The updated bumper is also compatible with iPhone 4s, the next-generation iPhone that has the same exterior design and measurements as the CDMA model of the iPhone 4, but with a SIM card slot as well.


Reception
--------------------------------------------------

Pre-release
--------------------------------------------------
Pre-release reception was largely positive.[73] The announcement included information that had not been covered by Gizmodo. Fox News commented that "seeing it in action is far more informative than staring at Gizmodo's photos of a busted test unit".[74] Rhodri Marsden of The Independent said that "aside from the introduction of face-to-face video calling, it's not a staggering feature set," instead focusing on how the device is "more powerful than its predecessor, speedier, easier to use and will make previously laborious tasks seem like a cinch".[75]

CNET reacted to the announcement by explaining how it believes that iMovie for iOS was the "most exciting part of this year's WWDC Keynote". The article noted how the iPhone 4, unlike current cameras, can record HD content and then edit it from the same device, labeling it a "true mobile editing suite".[76]


Reviews
--------------------------------------------------
Reviews of the iPhone 4 were largely positive. Walt Mossberg of The Wall Street Journal called the device "the best device in its class".[77] Engadget named it the "best smartphone on the market" in June 2010.[78] CNET gave the iPhone 4 a rating of 8.6 out of 10, one of the highest ratings it had given any smartphone.[79] TechRadar gave the device 4.5/5 stars.[80] Consumer Reports said the signal problem was the reason they did not rate it a "recommended" model, although the other tests ranked it highest among smartphones.[81]

Joshua Topolsky of Engadget described the device's industrial design as being "more detailed and sophisticated" than its predecessor.[78]


Technical problems
--------------------------------------------------
Some users reported a yellow discoloration of the screen that disappeared after several days, which was attributed to the glass lamination glue that was used. It did not have time to dry fully before the unit reached consumers due to the speed of manufacturing.[82] Another issue reported by some users within days of the iPhone 4 release was that during calls the proximity sensor can be insensitive, so that facial contact with the touchscreen can end calls, mute calls, and dial other numbers.[83] Some users reported that, particularly in low-light conditions, photos taken on the iPhone 4 sometimes contained blue or green "splotches." Issues with white balance were also discovered, particularly when using the flash.[84][85]


Antenna
--------------------------------------------------
Shortly after the iPhone 4 was launched, some users reported that signal strength of the phone was reduced when touching the lower left edge of the phone, bridging one of the two locations which separates the two antennas, resulting in dropped calls in some areas with lower signal reception.[86][87][88] In response, Apple issued a statement advising that customers should "avoid gripping [the phone] in the lower left corner" when making or receiving a call.[89] Internally, senior antenna expert Ruben Caballero raised concerns to CEO Steve Jobs that the antenna design could lead to dropped calls.[90]

As a consequence of this problem, it was reported on July 2, 2010 that several iPhone 4 users were planning on suing Apple and AT&T for fraud by concealment, negligence, intentional misrepresentation and defective design. The legal challenge was started by a law firm, who set up a website to recruit disenchanted iPhone 4 buyers for a lawsuit against Apple.[91][92] Later that day, Apple issued another statement stating that it had discovered the cause of the "dramatic drop in bars".[93]

Apple explained how the formula it used to calculate the number of bars to display was "totally wrong". Apple promised to correct the issue and release a software update within a few weeks that would address the "mistake", which had been present since the original iPhone.[93] The New York Times commented that "the failure to detect this longstanding problem earlier is astonishing."[94]

Consumer Reports initially stated that the iPhone 4's signal issues are not "unique, and may not be serious" and it continued to mention that signal loss is a problem that is faced by the entire smartphone industry. It was such a problem that Apple made a formal apology onstage. The next day, the magazine altered their stance after encountering instances of dropped calls.[95] The magazine rejected Apple's explanation after conducting tests in a controlled environment, and comparing the results against prior generations of iPhone. It sarcastically pointed out that using a piece of tape to cover the lower left antenna gap was one way to fix the problem, but recommended that consumers who "want an iPhone that works well without a masking-tape fix" purchase the iPhone 3GS instead.[81] The magazine also tested the iPhone 4 while it was wearing a Bumper, a frame-like cover sold by Apple that prevents direct contact with the antenna, reporting that it did resolve the problem.[96] CNN repeated Consumer Reports' statement that a small amount of duct tape had proven an effective fix to the iPhone 4's dropped call issue.[97]

On July 16, 2010, at a press conference which included a private tour of Apple's antenna design lab for journalists,[98] Steve Jobs announced that Apple would provide all iPhone 4 owners with a free case to help solve the antenna issue and a refund to those users who had already purchased a Bumper. The free case offer would be valid until September 30, 2010, when Apple would re-evaluate the situation.[99][100] To get a free case, owners were able to apply via an app installed on the phone found in the App Store from July 22, 2010 to September 30, 2010. Jobs also announced that Apple could not produce enough Bumpers for all owners of the phone, but would source a supply and offer a range of cases.[101] Additionally, Jobs cited figures from AppleCare which showed that only 0.55 percent of all iPhone 4 users have complained to the company about the issue, while the number of phones returned to Apple was 1.7 percent – 4.3 percentage points less than the number of iPhone 3GS models that were returned in the first month of the phone's launch.[101]

Consumer Reports noted that the solution was not permanent, though a good first step.[102] However, because Jobs did not specify a time line for fixing the problem, and the offering for a free bumper only being a temporary solution, PC World decided to remove the iPhone 4 from its "Top 10 Cell Phones" chart and reassign it to a pending rating.[103]

Despite the negative media attention regarding the antenna issues, 72% of iPhone 4 users said that they were "very satisfied" with their iPhone 4 according to an August 2010 survey by ChangeWave Research.[104] The GSM iPhone 4 continued to be sold unchanged until its discontinuation in September 2013, while the CDMA iPhone 4 and all models of the iPhone 4S featured a tweaked antenna design to prevent the issue from happening.


iPhones in space
--------------------------------------------------
In 2011, two iPhone 4 units equipped with a special application were taken to the International Space Station aboard the Space Shuttle on the STS-135 mission.[105] The devices were used in various experiments, utilizing sensors and a special app.[105]

List of iPhone models

The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus[a] are smartphones that were developed and marketed by Apple Inc. They are the tenth generation of the iPhone. They were announced on September 7, 2016, at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco by Apple CEO Tim Cook, and were released on September 16, 2016, succeeding the iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus as the flagship devices in the iPhone series. Apple also released the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in numerous countries worldwide throughout September and October 2016. They were succeeded as flagship devices by the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus[12] on September 12, 2017, and were discontinued with the announcement of the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro on September 10, 2019.

The iPhone 7's overall design is similar to the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S. Changes introduced included new color options (Matte Black and Jet Black), water and dust resistance, a new capacitive, static home button, revised antenna bands, and the controversial removal of the 3.5 mm headphone jack. The device's internal hardware received upgrades, including a heterogeneous quad-core system-on-chip with improved system and graphics performance, upgraded 12 megapixel rear-facing cameras with optical image stabilization on all models, and an additional telephoto lens exclusive to the iPhone 7 Plus to provide enhanced (2x) optical zoom capabilities and portrait mode. The front camera is the first in the series with 1080p (Full HD) video resolution. The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus were supported from iOS 10 to iOS 15, and they are the third to support six versions of iOS before support was terminated, after the iPhone 5s.

The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus were the last iPhones using a quad-core CPU, as well as an aluminum unibody design without wireless charging and a base model starting at 32 GB of internal storage.

The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus were the only iPhones to have a jet black color finish.


History
--------------------------------------------------
Prior to its announcement, multiple aspects of the iPhone 7 were heavily rumoured. Apple's plans to remove the 3.5 mm headphone jack received significant media attention.[b] Other rumors included a flush camera, stereo speakers,[17] a 256 gigabyte storage option, and a larger 3,100 mAh battery.[18]

On August 29, 2016, invitations to a press event at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco, California on September 7, 2016, were sent out to members of the media, prompting immediate speculation of the iPhone 7's upcoming announcement.[19][20] The iPhone 7 was officially announced at that event, with pre-orders beginning September 9, and general availability on September 16.[21][22][23]

The iPhone 7 launched in 30 new countries later in September, with further international rollouts throughout October and November 2016.[c] Indonesia was the last country to release the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, with availability starting on March 31, 2017, following Apple's research and development investment in the country.[31]

On March 21, 2017, Apple announced an iPhone 7 with a red color finish (and white front), as part of its partnership with Product Red to highlight its AIDS fundraising campaign. It launched on March 24, 2017,[32][33] but it was later discontinued after the announcement of the iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X in September 2017 as well as the 256 GB Variant.[34]

On September 12, 2017, Apple announced the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus as direct successors to the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus,[35] alongside the iPhone X.[36]

The iPhone 7 & 7 Plus, as well as the iPhone XS and its Max variant were discontinued and removed from Apple's website after the announcement of the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro on September 10, 2019. They are no longer available for sale.

On June 6, 2022, Apple announced on its website that the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus will not receive support for iOS 16. Controversially, the iPad (5th generation), which has the A9 chip, received iPadOS 16, along with the 6th and 7th generation iPads, which have almost identical hardware to the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus respectively.[37]


Specifications
--------------------------------------------------

Design
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 7's exterior is similar in shape and volume to the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S, although the camera bump is bigger on the iPhone 7. Alongside the existing silver, gold, and rose gold colors, the device is offered in new colors of matte black, glossy "jet black",[21] and, for a limited time, red.[32][33] The "jet black" color is a dark shade, high-gloss black finish. It is created through a multi-step process, beginning with an anodization phase to make the surface of the casing a porous aluminum oxide, and then using a machine to sweep the casing through a powdered compound, absorbed by aluminum oxide. The process is concluded with an "ultrafine particle bath" for additional finishing; the entire process takes less than an hour.[38]


Water protection
--------------------------------------------------
iPhone 7 is rated IP67 water and dust resistant, making it the first officially water-resistant iPhone,[39] although tests have resulted in malfunctions, specifically distorted speakers, after water exposure.[40] The warranty does not cover any water damage to the phone.[41]


Home button
--------------------------------------------------
iPhone 7's home button uses a capacitive mechanism for input rather than a physical push-button, as on previous models, meaning direct skin contact (or a capacitive glove) is required to operate the device.[42][43] Physical feedback is provided via a Taptic Engine vibrator, and the button is also pressure-sensitive.[44] iPhone 7 retains the 3D Touch display system introduced on the iPhone 6S, providing pressure-sensitive touchscreen input.[21]


Headphone plug removal
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are the first iPhones not to feature a 3.5mm headphone jack. It was replaced by a second speaker grille that serves as a vent for the internal barometer.[45] A Lightning-to-3.5-mm-connector adapter, as well as in-ear headphones that use the Lightning connector, were bundled with the device,[21] and the adapter is also sold separately as an accessory.[46] The adapter is also compatible with other iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch devices running iOS 10 and newer.[47]


Hardware
--------------------------------------------------

Chipsets
--------------------------------------------------
iPhone 7 uses the Apple A10 Fusion 64-bit system-on-chip, which consists of two low-power cores and two high-power cores (only two cores are used at any point in time[48]). The A10 chip also features a hexa-core graphics chip capable of "console-level gaming".[49] As with prior models, iPhone 7 is available in two sizes: one with a 4.7 in (120 mm) screen, and a "Plus" variant with a 5.5 in (140 mm) screen.[50] The displays have identical sizes and resolutions to iPhone 6S, but with a wider color gamut[21] and increased brightness.[51] The screen-to-body ratio is about ~66% and ~68% for the 7 and 7 Plus, respectively.[52][53]

Both device variants also contain a new iteration of Apple's motion coprocessor, the M10.[54] Unlike previous iPhone models, internal storage options for iPhone 7 begin at 32 GB instead of 16 GB, and max out at 256 GB.[55] iPhone 7 Plus offers 3 GB of RAM, more than any other previous iPhone;[48] the 4.7-inch iPhone 7 has 2 GB.[56]


Cameras
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 7 includes a 12-megapixel rear-facing camera with a quad-LED "True Tone" flash; its aperture was widened to f/1.8, and the standard-size phone model adds optical image stabilization – a feature that was previously exclusive to Plus models.[57]

The iPhone 7 Plus includes a second 12-megapixel telephoto lens, which can be used to achieve 2× optical zoom, and up to 10× digital zoom. However, the telephoto camera has an f/2.8 aperture and lacks optical image stabilization.[58]

The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus record video with single-channel mono audio.[59]

Still photos with 6.5 megapixels (3412×1920) can be captured during video recording.[60]

The front-facing camera was upgraded to a 7-megapixel sensor with automatic image stabilization.[21][61]

The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are the first iPhones to be able to record 1080p video using the front camera.[62]


Battery life
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 7 has a 1,960 mAh battery which can last about 3–5 hours. The iPhone 7 Plus has 2,900 mAh battery and can last for 5–8 hours.


Software
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 7 originally shipped with iOS 10 pre-installed.[63] The iPhone 7 Plus received an exclusive portrait camera mode in the iOS 10.1 software update.[64] This camera mode is capable of producing a bokeh effect using depth of field analysis of the second camera of dual-lens in the back of iPhone 7 Plus. Mainstream software support for the iPhone 7 was dropped when iOS 16 was released.[65][66] But, it still receives iOS 15 security updates (as of January 22, 2024). The current version of iOS to support iPhone 7 is iOS 15.8.3.[67] The device can also run Android 10 unofficially via a project called Project Sandcastle made by Corellium, a security research company that produces paid iOS, Android, and IoT emulators.[68] Ubuntu 20.04 "Focal Fossa" has also been ported via Project Sandcastle.[69]


Accessories
--------------------------------------------------
Each iPhone 7 originally came with a Lightning-to-3.5-mm adapter,[21] although this was omitted starting on September 12, 2018.[70] Apple sells the adapter independently as well.[46] iPhone 7 does not have a built-in DAC, a Cirrus Logic CS4272 DAC is included as part of the adapter. Apple also unveiled several Bluetooth wireless headphones ostensibly intended for use with the iPhone 7, including AirPods, wireless in-ear headphones, and three new Beats headphone products. All four products utilize an in-house wireless chip known as the Apple W1, which is designed to provide low-power Bluetooth operation and integration with iOS and macOS devices (though they are still compatible with other Bluetooth-supported devices).[71][72]


Reception
--------------------------------------------------
Reception of the iPhone 7 was mixed. Although reviewers noted improvements to the camera, especially the dual rear camera on the Plus model, the phone was criticized for the lack of innovation in its build quality. Many reviews panned the removal of the 3.5 mm headphone jack; some critics argued that the change was meant to bolster licensing of the proprietary Lightning connector and the sales of Apple's own wireless headphone products, and questioned the effects of the change on audio quality. Apple was also mocked by critics for Phil Schiller's statement that such a drastic change required "courage".

Gordon Kelly of Forbes noted that rival smartphones, such as the Samsung Galaxy S7, had increased battery life and added water resistance over its predecessor while retaining the headphone jack, and that the iPhone 7's camera photo quality was improved but still lagging behind some phones already on the market, including the Galaxy S7 and Nexus 6P. Kelly praised how Apple was able to extract improved brightness and accurate color reproduction from its LCD display panel, while noting that it was old technology which was also well behind rivals who had already moved to sharper 1080p or even 2K screens. The iPhone 7's exterior, which reuses the aging design of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S, was criticized, especially the size of the device and thick top/bottom bezels, with Kelly writing that "the iPhone 7 Plus is simply far too big for a smartphone with a 5.5-inch display".[73]

Nilay Patel of The Verge described the device as being "full of aggressive breaks from convention," noting the headphone jack removal, heterogeneous CPU, and home button redesign, going as far as dubbing it "a prototype of next year's rumored drastic iPhone redesign disguised as an iPhone 6." The display quality was considered an improvement over previous models, albeit "not as insane" as the quad HD displays on competing phones. The Taptic Engine was considered the "first really valuable new UI concept I've seen on phones in years" (as opposed to the "gimmick" of 3D Touch), Patel felt that the cameras of the devices were a step above the 6S in terms of performance, and praised the dual-lens camera on the 7 Plus for enhancing the phone's camera functionality. However, he panned the lack of editing features that made use of them. In regards to the enhanced Bluetooth audio support provided by devices containing the W1 chip, he argued that Apple "took away an established open standard in favor of new technologies, but instead of making the experience of using those new technologies better across the board, it made every third-party wireless audio product a second-class citizen of the Apple ecosystem." Giving the iPhone 7 a 9 out of 10, he concluded that the devices were "legitimately among the most interesting, opinionated, powerful phones Apple has ever shipped, and the most confident expressions of the company's vision in a long time. iOS 10 is excellent, the cameras are better, and the performance is phenomenal. And the batteries last longer."[74]

John McCann of TechRadar wrote that for the first time, the phablet-sized iPhone 7 Plus was "markedly better" than the smaller model. He highlighted improved battery life and praised the camera, calling the Plus' dual cameras "excellent" for point-and-shoot, and "much improved" for low-light performance. McCann wrote that the lack of a headphone jack was "initially frustrating", but noted that it was a "positive step forward for the mobile industry", despite the "short-term effects ... making the most noise for now".[75]


Headphone jack controversy
--------------------------------------------------
Criticism of the iPhone 7 centered around the removal of the headphone jack, including the inability to use wired headphones with the included adapter and charge the device simultaneously.[d][77]

In a particularly scathing article, Nilay Patel of The Verge wrote that removing the headphone jack, "a deeply established standard" as he put it, would be "user-hostile and stupid". He goes on to list reasons why removing the port is negative, concluding with "No one is asking for this" and "Vote with your dollars".[78]

Gordon Kelly of Forbes noted that wireless audio technology was immature at the moment, with Bluetooth audio quality being inferior and Lightning's audio reliability still in question. The removal of the headphone jack meant that in Patel's words, "You're being pushed into an era where you will have to pay more for decent headphones due to their need for an integrated DAC and/or Lightning licensing", and pointed out that "the only company to profit from this situation is Apple, who will now be charging licensing fees to millions of headphone companies".[73]

In particular, Apple's vice president Phil Schiller, who announced the change, was mocked extensively online for stating that removing the headphone jack took 'courage'.[79][80] An online petition created by the consumer group SumOfUs, that accuses Apple of planned obsolescence and causing substantial electronic waste by removing the headphone jack,[81] reached over 300,000 signatures.[82]


Issues
--------------------------------------------------

Hissing noises
--------------------------------------------------
Some users have reported a strange hissing noise during heavy usage of the phone. CNET reports it as "faint buzzes and hums coming from the backside".[83] The Daily Telegraph speculates that the iPhone 7's new A10 Fusion processor is the source of the noise, linking to tweets that compare the phone's hissing sound to "hearing the fans spin up loudly whenever your Mac's CPU gets used to its actual potential."[84]


Performance differences
--------------------------------------------------
The Guardian reported in October 2016 that storage tests from Unbox Therapy and GSMArena showed that the 32 GB iPhone 7 is "significantly" slower than the 128 and 256 GB versions, measuring data write speeds of 341 MB/s on a 128 GB iPhone 7 model versus 42 MB/s on a 32 GB model.[85] October 2016 network tests by Cellular Insights showed that models A1660 and A1661 with Qualcomm modems had "a significant performance edge" over models A1778 and A1784 with Intel modems. Inspection of the modems also found that the Qualcomm version's ability to use Ultra HD Voice had been turned off, likely to "level the playing field between the Qualcomm, and Intel variants". The report concluded with the statement that "We are not sure what was the main reason behind Apple's decision to source two different modem suppliers for the newest iPhone".[86][87] Bloomberg reported in November 2016 that tests by researchers from Twin Prime and Cellular Insights had shown the two modems to perform similarly on some U.S. cellular networks despite one of the modems being technically capable of faster connectivity. Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller told the publication that "Every iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus meets or exceeds all of Apple's wireless performance standards, quality metrics, and reliability testing ... In all of our rigorous lab tests based on wireless industry standards, in thousands of hours of real-world field testing, and in extensive carrier partner testing, the data shows there is no discernible difference in the wireless performance of any of the models". Bloomberg quoted analysts and technology advisers who stated that "[Apple] don't want one version to get the reputation that it is better" and that "This may not impact the fanboys, but it may make other consumers think twice about buying an Apple phone, especially if they think they might be purchasing a sub-standard product".[88]


Perception of slogan in Cantonese-speaking regions
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 7's "This is 7" slogan has been misunderstood when translated to certain other languages.[89][90] The phone's slogan in Mainland China is "7, is here;" (Chinese: 7，在此; pinyin: 7, zài cǐ), while in Hong Kong, its slogan is, "This, is iPhone 7;" (Chinese: 這，就是iPhone 7; Jyutping: ze5, zau6 si6 iPhone 7).

In Cantonese, the local language of Hong Kong, the slogan could be mistakenly interpreted as "This is penis". "Tsat", (Chinese: 杘; Jyutping: cat6), is a common slang term for an erect penis, and "seven", (Chinese: 七; Jyutping: cat1), which varies only in tone, is often used as a euphemism.[citation needed]


Replacing the home button
--------------------------------------------------
In the iPhone 7, Apple added a software lock that prevents individuals from attempting to replace the home button on their own. Users are now required to go to an Apple Store to have repairs done, with "recalibration" of the button being necessary. This is a step further than Apple went with iPhone 5S, 6 and 6S, where only Touch ID functionality would get disabled but the "return-to-home" functionality still worked.[91][92]


Failure to connect to cellular service
--------------------------------------------------
Some iPhone 7 devices with the model numbers A1660, A1779 and A1780 suffer from a problem where they show a "No service" message even when cellular reception is available. Apple will repair those devices for free within four years of the first retail sale of the unit.[93]


Loop disease
--------------------------------------------------
Some iPhone 7 devices suffer from a problem that affects audio in the device. Users reported a grayed-out speaker button during calls, grayed-out voice memo icon, and occasional freezing of the device. A few users also complained that lightning EarPods failed to work with the device and that the Wi-Fi button would be grayed out after restarting the iPhone. On May 4, 2018, Apple acknowledged the issue through an internal memo. If an affected iPhone 7 was no longer covered by warranty, Apple said its service providers could request an exception for this particular issue. The exemptions abruptly ended in July 2018 when Apple deleted the internal document. Many customers have complained Apple has charged customers around $350 to fix the issue. Many customers complain the issue first appeared after a software update.


Sales
--------------------------------------------------
Apple has deliberately withheld pre-order sales numbers, citing that these are "no longer a representative metric for our investors and customers".[94] Without releasing specific numbers, T-Mobile US stated that the iPhone 7 had broken the carrier's all-time record for first-day pre-order sales. The following weekend, T-Mobile US stated that iPhone 7 was its biggest iPhone launch ever, being "up nearly 4x compared to the next most popular iPhone".[95]

On September 14, 2016, two days before the iPhone 7 went on sale, Apple announced that due to high demand, they had sold out of all "jet black" iPhone 7's, and all colors of the iPhone 7 Plus.[96] This caused issues for customers in the iPhone Upgrade Program, who were unable to reserve new phones.[97] After customer complaints and a class action lawsuit,[98] Apple made changes to ensure members of the program could get new phones as soon as possible.[99]

In May 2017, analytics research company Strategy Analytics announced that iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus were the best-selling smartphones worldwide during the first quarter of 2017, selling 21.5 million and 17.4 million units, respectively.[100][101]


US carrier trade-in deals
--------------------------------------------------
For the initial U.S. sales of the iPhone 7, all four major wireless carriers announced trade-in deals. Under the deals, the monthly installment plan cost of the iPhone 7 is negated by a monthly credit on consumers' bill, but consumers who cancel their service with the carrier or pay off the phone prior to the installment contract completion will not receive credits for the remaining months.[102] Jacob Kastrenakes of The Verge noted that the deals effectively constituted a return to two-year phone contracts, in which the deals "essentially lock you into that carrier for two years".[103]

In the wake of these deals, Verizon announced they had seen an increase in sales over the release of the previous year's iPhone 6S, AT&T said that sales had exceeded its expectations, and T-Mobile and Sprint announced "huge increases in sales", with T-Mobile seeing a demand roughly four times higher for the 7 than the 6.[104]


Reports about trimmed production
--------------------------------------------------
In December 2016, DigiTimes reported that Apple had reduced production of the iPhone 7 because of decreasing demand for the product after the initial surge of interest waned. A reason cited was consumers and suppliers turning their attention to next year's iPhone model.[105][106]

A new report from Nikkei at the end of December included details on sales and production of the iPhone 7. The report, "based on data from suppliers", stated that Apple would trim production of the iPhone 7 by 10% in the first quarter of 2017, following "sluggish" sales. Nikkei reported that Apple previously trimmed production of the iPhone 7 by 20% due to accumulated inventory of the previous model, but that the new models had "sold more sluggishly than expected". Additionally, the report notes that the "iPhone 7 Plus, which features two cameras on its back face, remains popular", but "a shortage of camera sensors has curbed Apple's ability to meet demand for the phones".[107]

List of iPhone models

The iPhone 11 is a smartphone developed and marketed by Apple Inc. It is the thirteenth generation of iPhone, succeeding the iPhone XR, and was unveiled on September 10, 2019, alongside the higher-end iPhone 11 Pro at the Steve Jobs Theater in Apple Park, Cupertino, by Apple CEO Tim Cook. Preorders began on September 13, 2019, and the phone was officially released on September 20, 2019, one day after the official public release of iOS 13.

Despite minimal exterior changes from the preceding iPhone XR, substantial design changes within the phone took place, including the addition of the more powerful Apple A13 Bionic chip as well as an ultra-wide dual-camera system.[9] In October 2020, Apple halted the inclusion of both Apple EarPods and the wall adapter, citing environmental goals.[10][11]

As of March 2022[update], the iPhone 11 has sold 159.2 million units worldwide, making it the tenth best-selling smartphone of all time.[12][13]

The iPhone 11 as well as the iPhone 12 mini and iPhone 13 Pro with its Max variant were discontinued and removed from Apple's website after the announcement of the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro on September 7, 2022.


History
--------------------------------------------------
Details regarding the smartphone were widely leaked before the official release; complete specifications and renderings of the phone were widely publicized. Among the most significant changes were improvements in the cameras and the continuation of the 'notch' design around the frontal camera which dipped down into the screen, a feature started by the iPhone X.[14][15][16] The official event invite which was sent out to developers contained a graphic featuring an Apple logo made of layered colored glass, implied to be the new colors for the phone. A patent filed by Apple earlier in the year also hinted at a new camera design.[17][18]


Design
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 11 was available in six colors: Purple, Yellow, Green, Black, White and Product (Red). The top of the screen retains the 'notch' design, wherein the TrueDepth camera system and phone speaker are encapsulated in a black, rounded-out rectangle that dips into the screen, similar to its predecessor, the iPhone XR. An elevated area in the top corner on the back of the iPhone acts as a camera housing, containing the microphone, the flashlight, and both of the rear-facing digital cameras.[11][19] The Apple logo on the back of the phone is centered to be equidistant to all edges and is made of a reflective material.


Specifications
--------------------------------------------------

Hardware
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 11, along with the iPhone 11 Pro, uses Apple's A13 Bionic processor, which contains a third-generation neural engine. It has three internal storage options: 64 GB, 128 GB, and 256 GB.[20] It also has 4 GB of RAM.[21] The iPhone 11 has an IP68 water- and dust-resistant rating along with dirt and grime, and is water-resistant up to 2 m (6.6 ft) for 30 minutes. However, the manufacturer's warranty does not cover liquid damage to the phone. Also, like previous iPhones, both phones do not have a headphone jack, and initially came with wired EarPods with a Lightning connector, although Apple no longer includes these with any device.[11][21] The iPhone 11 is the first smartphone with built-in ultra wideband hardware, via its Apple U1 chip.[22][23][24]


Display
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 11 has a 6.1-inch (15 cm) IPS LCD with a resolution of 1792 × 828 pixels (1.4 megapixels) at a pixel density of 326 PPI with a maximum brightness of 625 nits and a 1400:1 contrast ratio and it is equivalent to the iPhone XR. It supports Dolby Vision, HDR10, True-Tone, and a wide color gamut. As with the iPhone 11 Pro, XR, XS, and X, the display has a notch at the top for the TrueDepth camera system and the speaker. The display has an oleophobic coating, making it fingerprint-resistant.[2][21] Apple announced in September 2019 that both the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro would show a warning notification if a display were replaced with an unauthorized part. Apple stated that problems with the phone could arise if the wrong parts or procedures were used during the repair process.[25]


Battery
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 11 is supplied with a 11.91 Wh (3,110 mAh) battery, a slight increase from the 11.21 Wh (2,942 mAh) found in the iPhone XR. The battery is not user-replaceable.


Camera
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 11 includes a dual-lens 12 MP rear camera array. It has one ƒ/2.4 ultra-wide-angle lens with a 120° field of view and 2× optical zoom out, and one ƒ/1.8 wide-angle lens. The iPhone 11 supports 4K video at up to 60 fps and 1080p slow motion at up to 240 fps.[2] The phone also features an audio zoom feature, which focuses audio on the area on which is being zoomed in, similar to the Pro model.[21] Both of the cameras support video, although only the primary lens has OIS. It supports portrait mode with six portrait lighting effects, depth control, and an advanced bokeh effect. The phone also has an automatic night mode allowing the camera to take brighter pictures with reduced noise in low-light environments. Also, a redesigned camera app adds new features such as a scroll wheel for choosing between the different lenses and a feature called "QuickTake", which allows the user to long-press the shutter button to take a video. Apple has also announced a new Deep Fusion feature that takes advantage of AI and machine learning for image processing and was released via iOS 13.2 software update on October 29, 2019.[2][21][26]


Software
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 11 was supplied with iOS 13,[27] which includes Siri, Face ID (through the TrueDepth camera), Apple Pay, and Apple Card support. It received iOS 14 on September 16, 2020, iOS 15 on September 20, 2021, iOS 16 on September 12, 2022, iOS 17 on September 18, 2023.[28] and iOS 18 on September 16, 2024.[29]


Reception
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 11 drew generally positive reviews after its launch.[27][30] Reviews generally praised the phone's performance, battery life, and cameras, while criticizing the display as passable, but aging quickly. Reviewers also criticized the notch as being far too large for 2019. According to Counterpoint Research's Market Pulse, it was the second best-selling and the most popular model globally for 2019, in less than four months of launch.[31]


Controversy
--------------------------------------------------

Removal of the power adapter and EarPods
--------------------------------------------------
Apple, through an environmental initiative, has removed the EarPods and power adapter from new iPhone boxes starting October 2020, including the iPhone 11. Removing these items is claimed to reduce e-waste and permit a smaller iPhone box, allowing more devices to be transported simultaneously to decrease carbon footprint. However, Apple now includes a USB-C to Lightning cable, incompatible with the existing USB-A power adapters that Apple previously supplied with their devices. Upgraders can still use their existing iPhone power adapters and cables, but users wanting fast charging capabilities will have to purchase a USB-C power adapter separately.[32]

List of iPhone models

The iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Mini (stylized and marketed as iPhone 12 mini) are smartphones developed and marketed by Apple Inc. They are the fourteenth-generation iPhones, succeeding the iPhone 11.[19] They were unveiled at a virtually held Apple Special Event at Apple Park in Cupertino, California, on October 13, 2020, alongside the "premium flagship" iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max and HomePod Mini. Pre-orders for the iPhone 12 started on October 16, 2020, and the phone was released in most countries on October 23, 2020, alongside the iPhone 12 Pro and fourth-generation iPad Air. Pre-orders for the iPhone 12 Mini began on November 6, 2020, and the phone was released on November 13, 2020, alongside the iPhone 12 Pro Max.[20]

The major upgrades over the iPhone 11[21] include the addition of a Super Retina XDR OLED as opposed to the Liquid Retina LED-backlit LCD IPS panel on the iPhone 11 and XR, 5G support, the introduction of MagSafe, Apple A14 Bionic system on a chip (SoC) and high-dynamic-range video Dolby Vision 4K up to 30 fps.[22] The iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Mini, like the iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max, are the first iPhone models from Apple to no longer include a power adapter or EarPods headphones found in prior iPhone models; however, a USB-C to Lightning cable is included; this change was retroactively applied to other iPhone models sold by Apple, such as the iPhone XR, iPhone 11 and the second-generation iPhone SE.


Design
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 12 and 12 Mini is the first major redesign since the iPhone X. It features a chassis with flat edges, similar to the iPhone 4 and iPhone 5 designs, as well as the iPad Pro since 2018, and the 4th-generation iPad Air, which was also released in 2020. The notch size is similar to previous iPhone models, despite speculation about a reduction in width.[23] The borders around the display are thinner by 35% than any previous model. The new design also comes with a ceramic-hardened front glass, marketed as Ceramic Shield, while the back retains the previous generation Dual-Ion Exchange strengthened glass.[24]

On April 20, 2021, at Apple's Special Event “Spring Loaded”, Apple revealed a new purple color option which became available on April 30, 2021.[25]

The iPhone 12 and 12 Mini are available in six colors: Black, White, Product Red, Green, Blue, and Purple.[24]


Specifications
--------------------------------------------------

Hardware
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Mini use Apple's six-core A14 Bionic processor, which contains a next-generation neural engine. They both have three internal storage options: 64, 128, and 256 GB.[a] Both also carry an IP68 water and dust resistance rating along with dirt and grime, and is water-resistant up to six meters (20 feet) for 30 minutes. However, the manufacturer warranty does not cover liquid damage to the phone.

The iPhone 12 series are the first iPhone models to be supplied from launch without EarPods or a wall adapter, which Apple says was done to reduce carbon emissions and waste since most users already own them. Apple also claims 70% more boxes can fit on a pallet given the smaller box, and thus further reducing emissions.[26] A USB-C to Lightning cord is still included. This change also applies retroactively to all other iPhone models still in production.[27] To comply with French law regarding wireless device radiation and health which requires phones to be bundled with and promote use of hands-free accessories by children under 14, iPhone models will still include EarPods in this market.[28]

A magnetic connector known as MagSafe is introduced on the iPhone 12 models, allowing accessories such as cases and charging cords to be attached to the rear of the device. Accessories can also be stacked together.[29]

The devices support 5G cellular communications. This allows upload speeds of up to 200 Mbit/s and download speeds of up to 4 Gbit/s.[30] However, only models sold in the U.S. support the fastest mmWave technology; those sold elsewhere in the world, including Canada, support only sub-6 GHz frequency bands.[31] A new feature called Smart Data Mode enables 5G only when necessary to preserve battery life.[32]


Displays
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 12 features a 6.1-inch (155 mm) display[33] with Super Retina XDR OLED technology at a resolution of 2532 × 1170 pixels and a pixel density of about 460 ppi.[34] The iPhone 12 Mini features a 5.4-inch (137 mm) display with the same technology at a resolution of 2340 × 1080 pixels, and a pixel density of about 476 ppi. Both phones have a peak brightness of 1200 nits when viewing HDR content equivalent to the iPhone 12 Pro, and normal brightness of 625 nits.[34] Both phones also use an improved glass-ceramic covering called Ceramic Shield which is co-developed with Corning Inc. Apple describes it as having "4 times better drop performance" and being "tougher than any smartphone glass".[35]


Batteries
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 12 has a 10.78 Wh (2,815 mAh) battery, a slight decrease from the 11.91 Wh (3,110 mAh) battery found in the iPhone 11 and identical to the battery found in the iPhone 12 Pro. The iPhone 12 Mini has a 8.57 Wh (2,227 mAh) battery. Like previous iPhones, the battery is not user-replaceable.[36]


Chipsets
--------------------------------------------------
Both the iPhone 12 and 12 Mini have the Apple A14 Bionic, the first ARM-based smartphone system-on-a-chip (SoC) manufactured on the 5 nm process node. However, unlike previous years, they are not the first Apple devices to receive the newest A-series processor, with the fourth-generation iPad Air being the first. Both phones use Qualcomm's Snapdragon X55 5G modem.


Cameras
--------------------------------------------------
Both phones have two rear 12-megapixel cameras: wide and ultra-wide. The wide camera is a 26 mm full-frame equivalent with an f/1.6 aperture which captures 27% more light than the f/1.8 aperture in the iPhone 11[20] and a seven-element lens. The ultra-wide camera is a 13 mm full-frame equivalent with an f/2.4 aperture and a five-element lens.[37]

All cameras now support Night Mode for both photo and time-lapse video at full resolution.[24] Smart HDR has been improved thanks to Smart HDR 3.[37] This iPhone model is the first capable of shooting 10-bit high dynamic range Dolby Vision 4K video at up to 30 fps which allows for greater brightness and deeper shadows.[38]

The front-facing, TrueDepth camera features a 12-megapixel camera with an f/2.2 aperture. This model also added Night Mode to the front-facing camera.[24]

Sensors

The iPhone 12 and 12 Mini include mostly the same sensors found on prior iPhone models going back to the iPhone X. These include an accelerometer, gyroscope, barometer, proximity sensor, ambient light sensor, and a digital compass. The devices also include the Face ID sensor for biometric authentication.


Software
--------------------------------------------------
Both phones originally shipped with iOS 14.[24] The devices come with the stock iOS apps, such as Safari, Weather, and Messages, and they include Siri, the personal assistant in iOS. They received iOS 15 on September 20, 2021, iOS 16 on September 12, 2022, iOS 17 on September 18, 2023, and most recently, iOS 18 on September 16, 2024.[39]


Reception
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 12 received largely positive reviews. The Verge called it a "beautiful, powerful, and incredibly capable device", praising the new design reminiscent of the iPhone 5, the speed of the A14 Bionic processor, its 5G capabilities, addition of the OLED display like on the high end iPhones, combined with much slimmer bezels than previous iPhone models and improved battery life over iPhone 11.[40] Engadget also gave the iPhone 12 a positive review, praising the MagSafe wireless charging and accessories magnetic attachment as well as the redesigned camera system, a greatly improved display like in its Pro counterparts.[41]

iPhone 12 was the third best-selling and was the most popular model globally in Q2 2021.[42]

Apple was criticized for the continued reliance on Face ID as the sole biometric option to unlock the device, which is incompatible with face masks. iOS 14.5 allowed the use of a paired Apple Watch to unlock the phone while wearing a mask, while iOS 15.4 allows unlocking with a mask on, without an Apple Watch. The third-generation iPhone SE is the only iPhone currently produced by Apple that supports Touch ID, an alternative unlocking option that is compatible with face masks. All models can still use a passcode to log in.[43][44][45][46]

The iPhone 12 mini has received more mixed reviews. Some praised the phone for being a new small phone, while others criticized the price and inferior battery life compared to the full-size 12[47] (although the battery life of the iPhone 12 mini is longer than that of the second-generation iPhone SE[48]).


"OLED-gate"
--------------------------------------------------
Within two weeks after its public release, a thread was started at Apple Support Communities describing a problem with the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro OLED panel black pixels not shutting off completely in black scenes, resulting in what was described as "ugly glowing".[49] A considerable number of users have since posted replies reporting the same problem, photos and videos have been shared online demonstrating the issue. As of January 2021, Apple has not yet made an official statement.


EarPods and power adapter controversy
--------------------------------------------------
Apple no longer includes either EarPods or a power adapter in the boxes of all iPhone 12 and 12 Pro models, claiming that it is an environmental initiative and no longer including them would reduce e-waste and permit smaller iPhone boxes, allowing more devices to be transported simultaneously to decrease its carbon footprint. The boxes only include a USB-C to Lightning cable, incompatible with the existing USB-A power adapters that Apple previously supplied with its devices. Users can still use their existing USB-A power adapters and cables but must purchase a USB-C power adapter sold separately to enable fast charging.

The iPhone 12 was sold in France with EarPods as the law required that smartphones be bundled with “hands-free kits” or a “headset” in order to protect children aged 14 and younger from electromagnetic radiation.[50][51]

In December 2020, a Brazilian consumer rights watchdog Procon-SP Foundation requested Apple to provide proof that not including chargers is beneficial to the environment. The watchdog argues that Apple removing the charger is harming consumers and wants to force the company to include one as it claims the charger is an essential component.[52]

The Verge reported the reason power adapters and EarPods are no longer included could be to offset the increased cost of 5G components. These new components are reported to cost 30% more than their predecessors.[53]


Repairability concerns
--------------------------------------------------
iFixit and Australian YouTuber Hugh Jeffreys discovered that a number of key components such as the cameras would malfunction or display warnings if they are replaced with new ones or those taken from an otherwise identical donor unit.[54] Internal Apple documents also mention that, beginning with the iPhone 12 and in subsequent models, authorized technicians would have to run the phones through an internal System Configuration tool to reprogram repaired units in order to account for hardware changes. While Apple has yet to comment on the issue, the inability to replace key system components have raised concerns about right to repair and planned obsolescence.[55] However, the iPhone 12 Mini does not have this issue.[56] Apple later addressed the issue with the release of iOS 14.4, which displays a warning message if the phone detects an unpaired camera module but otherwise allows for full functionality.[57]


Electromagnetic radiation concerns
--------------------------------------------------
In September 2023, the French watchdog agency Agence nationale des fréquences [fr] notified Apple that sales of the iPhone 12 must be halted in France due to the device exceeding the legal specific absorption rate for consumer electronics. The agency also requested that Apple must recall all iPhone 12s that have been produced in order to meet safety regulations. However, this coincided with the release of the iPhone 15 models where Apple also discontinued the iPhone 12 globally.[58]

Despite the move however, France's digital minister did emphasize the iPhone 12's radiation levels[59] remained well below the threshold deemed harmful by scientific studies. Even Apple, "...disputed the findings and said the device complies with regulations..." [Regulations | source 39]. This highlighted a discrepancy between the agency's tests and real-world phone usage scenarios.[60]

List of iPhone models

The iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini (stylized as iPhone 13 mini) are smartphones developed and marketed by Apple. They are the fifteenth generation of iPhones, succeeding the iPhone 12 and 12 Mini. They were unveiled at an Apple Event in Apple Park in Cupertino, California, on September 14, 2021, alongside the higher-priced iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max flagships. They were released on September 24, 2021.[12][13]

The iPhone 13 Mini was discontinued in September 2023, and the iPhone 13 was discontinued in September 2024 with the announcement of the iPhone 16.


History
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini were officially announced alongside the ninth-generation iPad, 6th generation iPad Mini, Apple Watch Series 7, iPhone 13 Pro, and iPhone 13 Pro Max by a virtual press event filmed and recorded at Apple Park in Cupertino, California, on September 14, 2021. Pre-orders began on September 17, 2021, at 5:00 am PDT. Pricing starts at US$799 for the iPhone 13 and US$699 for the iPhone 13 Mini.[14]

Together with iPhone 12, the iPhone 13 Mini was discontinued on September 12, 2023, with the announcement of the iPhone 15 and 15 Pro. The iPhone 13 continues to be sold until the announcement of the iPhone 16 and 16 Pro on September 9, 2024, when it was discontinued alongside the iPhone 15 Pro.


Design
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 13 has a flat chassis analogous to that of contemporaneous Apple products with some differences such as the rear cameras being larger and arranged diagonally. The Face ID True Depth sensor housing on the iPhone is 20% smaller yet taller than its predecessors.[15]

The iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini are available in six colors: Midnight, Starlight, Product Red, Blue, Pink, and Green.[16][17]

On March 8, 2022, at Apple's Special Event "Peek Performance", Apple revealed a new Green color option, which became available and released on March 18, 2022. [16][17]


Specifications
--------------------------------------------------

Hardware
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini use an Apple-designed A15 Bionic system on a chip. The iPhone 13 and 13 Mini feature a 6-core CPU, 4-core GPU, and 16-core Neural Engine, while the iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max feature a 5-core GPU.[18]


Display
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 13 features a 6.1-inch (155 mm) display with Super Retina XDR OLED technology at a resolution of 2532×1170 pixels and a pixel density of about 460 PPI with a refresh rate of 60 Hz. The iPhone 13 Mini features a 5.4-inch (137 mm) display with the same technology at a resolution of 2340×1080 pixels and a pixel density of about 476 PPI. Both models have the Super Retina XDR OLED display with improved typical brightness up to 800 nits, and max brightness up to 1200 nits.[19]


Cameras
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 13 and 13 Mini feature the same camera system with three cameras: one front-facing camera (12MP f/2.2) and two back-facing cameras: a wide (12MP f/1.6) and ultra-wide (12MP f/2.4) camera. The back-facing cameras both contain larger sensors for more light-gathering with new sensor shift optical image stabilization (OIS) on the main camera. The camera module on the back is arranged diagonally instead of vertically to engineer the larger sensors.[3]

The cameras use Apple's latest computational photography engine, called Smart HDR 4. Users can also choose from a range of photographic styles during capture, including rich contrast, vibrant, warm, and cool. Apple clarifies this is different from a filter because it works intelligently with the image processing algorithm during capture to apply local adjustments to an image and the effects will be baked into the photos, unlike filters which can be removed after applying.[3]

The camera app contains a new mode called Cinematic Mode, which allows users to rack focus between subjects and create (simulate) shallow depth of field using software algorithms. It is supported on wide and front-facing cameras in 1080p at 30 fps.[3]


Charging
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 13 and 13 Mini have Lightning fast charging at 20 Watts, and wireless charging via MagSafe at 15 W (iPhone 13) or 12 W (13 Mini), or via the Qi protocol at 7.5 W.


Software
--------------------------------------------------
iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini were originally shipped with iOS 15 at launch.[20] They are compatible with iOS 16, which was released on September 12, 2022. The latest software iOS 17, which was revealed at Apple's WWDC 2023 event, is compatible with the iPhone 13 and 13 Mini.[21] The next-generation Qi2 wireless charging standard has been added to the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini with the update to iOS 17.2.[22] It is compatible with iOS 18, which was released on September 16, 2024.[23]

The 13 and 13 Mini are able to make calls via: FaceTime Audio / Video (not available in some regions); Voice over LTE (VoLTE); Wi-Fi Calling (not available in some regions models). Wi-Fi hotspotting is also possible


Repairability
--------------------------------------------------
Some iPhone 13 parts are paired to the motherboard. The user is warned if a paired component (e.g. screen, battery) is replaced by independent repair shops, and the Face ID sensors may completely cease to function if replaced. On later iOS versions Apple removed this limitation. Apple technicians have a proprietary software tool to pair components.[24][25]

List of iPhone models

The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus are smartphones developed and marketed by Apple Inc. They are the sixteenth-generation iPhones, succeeding the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini, and were announced during Apple Event, Apple Park in Cupertino, California, on September 7, 2022, alongside the higher-priced iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max flagships. The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus feature a 6.1-inch (15 cm) and 6.7-inch (17 cm) display, improvements to the rear-facing camera, and satellite connectivity for contacting emergency services when a user in trouble is beyond the range of Wi-Fi or cellular networks.[11][12] The iPhone 14 was made available on September 16, 2022,[13] and iPhone 14 Plus was made available on October 7, 2022, priced at $799 and $899 respectively and was launched with iOS 16.[8][14] Pre-orders for the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus began on September 9, 2022.[15] Along with the 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max, the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus are the last iPhones to feature the Lightning port, as their successors, the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus (announced on September 12, 2023), use a USB-C port instead, per European Commission regulation.[16][17]

The iPhone 14 does not have a "Mini" version like its predecessor, the iPhone 13. Instead, Apple returned to a larger model with the iPhone 14 Plus. Apple had not introduced a "Plus" model iPhone since the iPhone 8 Plus in 2017. Both iPhone 14 models (as well as iPhone 14 Pro models) sold in the United States, ended support for physical SIM cards, making them the first iPhone models since the CDMA variant of the iPhone 4 to not come with a discrete SIM card reader, requiring activation by way of eSIM.[18] With Apple retiring the iPhone 13 in September 2024, the iPhone 14 is currently the oldest iPhone model still fully supported and sold by Apple.


History
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 14 was originally rumored to come with 6.1-inch and 5.4-inch display size options. However, when the iPhone 14 was unveiled, no smaller display option was available. This may have been due to underwhelming sales of the iPhone 12 Mini and iPhone 13 Mini. Instead, a larger 6.7-inch display size option was added to the lower-priced iPhone 14 lineup.[19][20] The new 6.7-inch variant of the iPhone 14 was named "iPhone 14 Plus", rather than "iPhone 14 Max", which was predicted by previous rumors.[21][22]

The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus were officially announced at Apple's "Far Out" event, along with the iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 14 Pro Max, Apple Watch Series 8, Apple Watch SE (2nd generation), Apple Watch Ultra, AirPods Pro (2nd generation) and an update to Apple Fitness+ via a virtual press conference filmed at Apple Park in Cupertino, California on September 7, 2022.[23][24]

Apple started taking pre-orders on September 9, with general availability from September 16 for the iPhone 14 and October 7 for the iPhone 14 Plus.[25]


Design
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus have an identical design to the iPhone 13, although the US models do not have a physical SIM tray.

The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus are available in six colors: Blue, Purple, Midnight, Starlight, Yellow, and Product Red.[27] Purple is a new color replacing Pink used on the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini. The yellow colour option was added on March 7, 2023.[28]


Hardware
--------------------------------------------------
iPhone 14 and 14 Plus are available in three internal storage configurations: 128, 256, and 512 GB. Both models have 6 GB of RAM, an increase over the previous iPhone 13 and 13 mini models' 4 GB of RAM. The iPhone 14 and 14 Plus have the same IP68 rating for dust and water resistance as their predecessors.[7]


Chipset
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 14 and 14 Plus use a 5-nanometer Apple-designed SOC, the A15 Bionic, while the iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max have a newer A16 Bionic.[29][30]

The iPhone 14's A15 chip has a 6-core CPU, 5-core GPU, and a 16-core Neural Engine. It is identical to the A15 in the previous year's iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max,[29][30] which has more memory and an additional GPU core compared to the A15 in the non-Pro iPhone 13 models.[31][32]

The iPhone 14 was the first flagship model since the 2008 iPhone 3G, whose chip was unchanged from the previous year.[29] The Verge's Mitchell Clark attributed the unchanged chip to an attempt to maintain costs during the ongoing chip shortage and inflation surge. Clark also said the A15 "still outperforms the latest chips from Qualcomm and Google in most benchmarks", though the older chip may lead to the iPhone 14 receiving fewer updates, similar to what happened with the iPhone 5C from 2013.[29][30]


Display
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 14 features a 6.1-inch (155 mm) display with Super Retina XDR OLED technology at a resolution of 2532 × 1170 pixels and a pixel density of about 460 PPI with a refresh rate of 60 Hz. The iPhone 14 Plus features a 6.7-inch (170 mm) display with the same technology at a resolution of 2778 × 1284 pixels and a pixel density of around 458 PPI. Both models have typical brightness of up to 800 nits, and a max brightness of up to 1200 nits.[7]


Cameras
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 14 and 14 Plus feature the same camera system with two cameras: one front-facing camera (12MP f/1.9), and two back-facing cameras: a wide (12MP f/1.5) and ultra-wide (12MP f/2.4) camera, with the wide and front-facing cameras having a faster aperture than the iPhone 13. The front-facing camera also has autofocus for the first time.[33]

The cameras use Apple's latest computational photography engine, called Smart HDR 4. Users can also choose from a range of photographic styles during capture, including rich contrast, vibrant, warm, and cool. Apple clarifies this is different from a filter because it works intelligently with the image processing algorithm during capture to apply local adjustments to an image, and the effects will be baked into the photos, unlike filters which can be removed after applying.[7]

The camera app contains Cinematic Mode, which allows users to rack focus between subjects and create (simulate) shallow depth of field using software algorithms. It is supported on wide and front-facing cameras in 4K at 30 fps and 60 fps.[7]

An "Action mode" feature was added to extend the electrical video stabilization. When activated, a smaller crop of the image sensor is read out for video recording. While reducing the field of view, a wider area around it can be used as buffer against shakes. The area read out from the image sensor is moved between frames to counteract hand movements.[34]


Battery
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 14 is equipped with slightly longer battery life compared to the iPhone 13. According to Apple, the iPhone 14 (3,279 mAh) can provide up to 20 hours of video playback,[35] 16 hours of streaming video playback, and 80 hours of audio playback. Its predecessor, the iPhone 13 (3,240 mAh), is rated for up to 19 hours of video playback, 15 hours of streaming video playback, and 75 hours of audio playback. The larger iPhone 14 Plus (4,325 mAh) variant provides up to 26 hours of video playback.[36]


Software
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 14 and 14 Plus originally shipped with iOS 16. The next-generation Qi2 wireless charging standard was added to the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus with the update to iOS 17.2.[37] The latest version of iOS, iOS 18, which was revealed at Apple's WWDC 2024 event, was released to the public on September 16, 2024, and is compatible with the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus.

Satellite connectivity
--------------------------------------------------
Apple's new Emergency SOS via satellite service for iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro models uses the spectrum in L and S bands designated for mobile satellite services by ITU Radio Regulations. When an iPhone user makes an Emergency SOS via satellite request, the message is received by an orbiting satellite operated by Globalstar. The satellite then sends the message down to ground stations located across the globe.[11]

As of November 2022, Globalstar operates a constellation of 25 satellites in low Earth orbit, with plans to enhance this in the future via its partnership with Apple.[11][42]

The service became available to US and Canada on November 15, 2022, and to the UK, Germany, Ireland, and France on December 13, 2022.[43] From May 15, 2023 the service became available in Australia and New Zealand.[44]


Criticism
--------------------------------------------------

Crash Detection false positives
--------------------------------------------------
Crash Detection is a feature built into the iPhone 14 that is designed to detect severe car crashes and automatically initiates an emergency phone call 20 seconds after it is detected unless the user cancels it.[45] Since its release, there have been many reports saying that the feature was automatically turned on during rollercoaster rides, due to the fact that the rides suddenly stop after going at high speeds, acting the same way a car crash does.[46][47]

Emergency dispatchers have received many false alarm calls from iPhone 14 and Apple Watch users who have been skiing safely. In Colorado, a wave of false 9-1-1 calls led Aspen Mountain to advise device owners to upgrade their operating systems or disable the feature.[48] In Japan's Hida Mountains, emergency dispatchers reported 134 false emergency calls, more than 14% of the total emergency call volume, between December 16, 2022, and January 23, 2023, attributed to Crash Detection triggering while an iPhone 14 owner was skiing.[49]


Repairability
--------------------------------------------------
While the iPhone 14 was originally lauded for its innovative new hardware design and recommended by iFixit, concerns over software limitations on parts not authorized by Apple caused iFixit to decrease their evaluation to a 4/10 or "not recommended" in September 2023.[50][51]

Portrait Mode, Portrait Lighting, and Animoji

The iPhone XR (stylized and marketed as iPhone Xʀ;[18] Roman numeral "X" pronounced as "ten"[19]) is a smartphone developed and marketed by Apple Inc. It is part of the twelfth generation of the iPhone, alongside the higher-end iPhone XS/XS Max models. Pre-orders began on October 19, 2018, with the official release on October 26, 2018.[20] The iPhone XR was the least expensive device in Apple's twelfth generation of iPhones, which also includes the iPhone XS and XS Max, and was therefore considered an "affordable flagship" or "budget flagship" phone at its release.[21]

The XR shares key internal hardware but with features removed/downgraded to reduce the price.[22] The XR features the same processor as the XS and XS Max, the Apple A12 Bionic chip built with a 7 nanometer process, which Apple claimed to be the "smartest and most powerful chip" ever put into a smartphone.[23] Instead of the OLED screen on the XS, the XR has a 6.1-inch Liquid Retina LED-backlit LCD IPS panel display, which Apple claimed was the "most advanced LCD in the industry."[20] According to Apple, the full charge of the XR battery lasts up to one-and-a-half hours longer than that of its direct predecessor, the iPhone 8 Plus.[3]

The iPhone XR was available in six colors: black, white, blue, yellow, coral (a shade of pink and orange), and Product Red. It is the second iPhone to be released in white, yellow and blue, the first being the iPhone 5c in 2013.[20] Internationally, the phone supports dual SIMs through a Nano-SIM and an eSIM. In mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau, dual Nano-SIM (in a single tray) is offered instead.[24][25] The iPhone XR was available in three storage capacities: 64 GB, 128 GB, and 256 GB. The 256 GB version was discontinued with the release of the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro; while the iPhone XS was discontinued and replaced by the iPhone 11 Pro, the iPhone XR continued on sale at a lower price point with the iPhone 11 succeeding as the "affordable flagship".

The iPhone XR was Apple's best selling 2018 model. It also became the top-selling and the most popular smartphone globally in Q3 2019. As of September 2020, the iPhone XR has sold 77.4 million units worldwide, making it the eighth best-selling smartphone of all time.[26][27]

In 2019, Apple started assembling the iPhone XR in India.[28] The iPhone XR as well as the iPhone 12 Pro with its Max variant were discontinued and removed from Apple's website after the announcement of the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro on September 14, 2021, but is still available through third party retailers today.[when?]

List of iPhone models


History
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone XR was announced by Phil Schiller on September 12, 2018, at the Steve Jobs Theater in the Apple Park campus, alongside the higher-priced iPhone XS and XS Max, where all three products were showcased to the public.[29]


Design
--------------------------------------------------

Hardware
--------------------------------------------------
The XR has a similar design to the iPhone X and iPhone XS. However, it has slightly larger bezels, a bigger screen, an aluminum frame, and is available in a wide variety of colors. Similar to other X-branded iPhones, all models come with a black front. The XR has an IP67 rating for dust and water resistance, which means it can be immersed in 1-metre deep water for up to 30 minutes.

Released as part of the same twelfth generation, the XR has similar hardware to the XS, but with a few features removed to reduce the price. The XR features the same system-on-chip (SoC) as the XS and XS Max, the Apple A12 Bionic chip built with a 7 nanometer process.

The XR has an LCD display known as "Liquid Retina" instead of the OLED screen used on the X, XS, and XS Max. The display on the XR has a resolution of 1792 × 828 pixels and a pixel density of 326 ppi, compared with 458 ppi on other X-branded iPhones. However, it has 120 Hz Touch Sample Rate which is the same as the XS and XS Max.[30] Instead of 3D Touch, the XR comes with Haptic Touch where the user long-presses until they feel a vibration from the Taptic Engine. The screen-to-body ratio of the XR is 79.3%, much higher than the 67.5% of the iPhone 8 Plus but is still lower than most other phones in its price category.[31]

Unlike other phones in the X-series, the XR ships with a single camera on the rear on the phone, featuring exactly the same main camera sensor as on the XS and XS Max,[32] utilizing a 1/2.55" sensor size and 1.4μm pixel size.[30] Unlike the XS, it does not have optical zoom because of the single camera.[33] DxOMark gave the camera on the iPhone XR a rating of 101, giving the title "Top-ranked single-lens phone".[34] Despite the rear single-camera setup, a modified version of Portrait Mode is included. It works unaltered while using the TrueDepth front camera, but with the rear camera, it attempts to calculate the depth of field using a combination of the focus pixels on the image sensor and AI, resulting in more limitations including lower resolution depth data and subjects not being close enough due to the wide-angle lens being used instead of the missing telephoto lens. Just like the iPhone XS and XS Max, the iPhone XR also offers an adjustable depth of field through software, allowing the user to adjust the background bokeh effect after taking a photo.[citation needed]


Software
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone XR initially shipped with iOS 12 installed out of the box and is compatible with iOS 13, which was released to the public on September 19, 2019.[35] It received iOS 14 on September 16, 2020,[36] iOS 15 on September 20, 2021,[37] iOS 16 on September 12, 2022, iOS 17 on September 18, 2023,[38] and iOS 18 on September 16, 2024.[39]


Controversy
--------------------------------------------------

Display
--------------------------------------------------
Some online media outlets criticized the iPhone XR's display for having a low resolution and a low pixel per inch density, relative to other phones on the market at the time of release at the price point.[40] However, other online media outlets ignored these concerns, saying that under normal use, users should not be able to discern the pixels.[41][40]


Power adapter and EarPods
--------------------------------------------------
Apple, as part of an environmental initiative, removed the EarPods and power adapter from all new iPhone boxes starting in October 2020, including the iPhone XR. It is claimed that removing these items will reduce e-waste and permit a smaller iPhone box, allowing more devices to be shipped simultaneously to decrease carbon footprint. Apple only included a USB-C to Lightning cable, which was compatible with increasingly prevalent USB-C charging sources, but incompatible with the previous (and then more common) USB-A power adapter that Apple included with its devices, leading to Apple recommending users who don't have a USB-C based charging source to use existing USB-A to Lightning cables or buying a USB-C power adapter separately.[42]

List of iPhone models

The iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus are smartphones developed and marketed by Apple Inc. They are the eleventh generation of the iPhone. The iPhone 8 was released on September 22, 2017, succeeding the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, respectively.[9]

The designs of the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus are largely similar to that of their predecessors except for the addition of a glass back. The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus were the final flagship iPhone models to feature the home button and Touch ID. Notable changes include the removal of the rose gold and jet black color variants,[10] addition of inductive charging, a faster processor, and improved cameras and displays. The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus share most of their internal hardware with the iPhone X.

The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus were discontinued as of February 2020, having sold 86.3 million units worldwide, making them one of the best-selling smartphones of all time.[11][12][original research?] They initially shipped with iOS 11 and supported up to iOS 16, and do not support iOS 17.[13]

The second and third generations of the entry level iPhone SE retain the iPhone 8's exterior dimensions and Touch ID, with upgraded hardware.


History
--------------------------------------------------
Apple invited the press to a media event at the Steve Jobs Theater in the Apple Park campus on September 12, 2017.[14] The iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus were announced at that event, and released on September 22, 2017.[15]

On April 9, 2018, Apple introduced an iPhone 8 with a red color finish and a black front, in support of their partnership with Product Red and their AIDS fundraising campaign.[16]

In November 2018, just over a year from initial release, Apple started selling refurbished iPhone 8 models starting at $499.[17] The price was lowered to US$319.[18] Refurbished iPhone 8 Plus models were available starting at $599.[19] The price was also subsequently lowered to US$469 and later to $359.[20]

On April 15, 2020, Apple announced the second-generation iPhone SE and discontinued the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, which share the external form factor but has upgraded internals including an A13 Bionic processor.[21][22] On March 8, 2022, Apple announced the third-generation iPhone SE with the same exterior dimensions, but with an upgraded camera and Apple's A15 processor.


Specifications
--------------------------------------------------

Hardware
--------------------------------------------------

Display
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus retain the Retina HD Display found in the iPhone 7,[23] but they now feature True Tone technology, allowing for automatic screen adjustments based on surrounding ambient lighting.[15] They can play HDR10 and Dolby Vision content despite not having an HDR-ready display, done by down-converting the HDR content to fit the display while still having some enhancements to dynamic range, contrast, and wide color gamut compared to standard content.[24]


Camera
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus feature a 12 MP camera with autofocus, f/1.8 aperture and optical image stabilization capable of capturing 4K video at 24, 30, or 60 frames per second, or 1080p video at 30, 60, 120 or 240 frames per second,[25] and a Quad LED True Tone Flash with Slow Sync.[26] The Slow Sync flash, 4K 60fps, and 1080p 240 fps options are new features for the 8 and 8 Plus, over the options available on the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus.

The iPhone 8 Plus, like the iPhone 7 Plus, adds a second, telephoto, lens. A new AI-driven option is available for the iPhone 8 Plus, called Portrait Lighting--making use of the more capable image signal processor in the A11 SoC.[26]

Both models have a 7 MP front camera with an f/2.2 aperture capable of capturing 1080p video at 30 frames per second and 720p video at 24 frames per second, along with face detection and high-dynamic range.[25][27]

The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus record videos with single channel audio (mono).[28]

Still photos with 6.5 megapixels (3412×1920) can be captured during video recording.[29]


Chipset
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus contain the Apple A11 Bionic system-on-chip, a hexa-core processor that the company says features two performance cores that are 25% faster than those found in the iPhone 7's A10 processor and four efficiency cores that are 70% faster than those in the prior model. The phones also feature an Apple-designed graphics processing unit 30% faster than prior units, with the same level of performance as the A10 at half the power.[15]


Other
--------------------------------------------------
The phones have glass backs instead of the complete aluminum housing found on prior models, enabling the use of Qi inductive charging.[15] The phones are rated IP67 for water resistance and dust resistance. [30] Both models come with 64, 128, and 256 gigabytes storage options,[31][32] and are offered in silver, gold, or Space Gray color options.[15] A Product Red special edition version in red with a black front was released on April 9, 2018.[16] The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus were the last iPhones with white front in Silver and Gold colors.

In addition to Qi wireless charging, the iPhone 8 also supports wired charging using Apple's proprietary Lightning connector. It can fast-charge from a charger providing USB Power Delivery combined with a special USB-C to Lightning adapter cable supporting fast charging.[33]

The iPhone 8 has a 6 out of 10 reparability score from iFixit, mainly due to the use of excessive glue for the back glass.[34]


Software
--------------------------------------------------
Both the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus were supplied with iOS 11 on launch,[25][27] and support iOS 12, iOS 13, iOS 14, iOS 15 and iOS 16. Apple announced that the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, as well as the iPhone X, would not support iOS 17 due to hardware limitations.[35] However, the devices still receive security updates.


Reception
--------------------------------------------------
Reception of the phones was generally positive, with reviewers praising the addition of inductive charging, fast charge capability, and the new Apple A11 processor, while criticizing the aging design that was introduced with the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in 2014.

Samuel Axon of Ars Technica called the A11 processor "a marvelous feat of engineering", writing that it offers "industry-leading performance". Axon also praised the cameras, writing that "The colors are great, and low light performance is very good for a smartphone".[36] Chris Velazco of Engadget praised the speed of the A11 processor, the build quality and the "excellent" camera, while criticizing design familiarities with previous iPhone generations and limited water-protection levels compared to competitors.[37]

John McCann of TechRadar enjoyed the feel of the glass back despite criticizing the phone's overall design. McCann also praised the camera and called inductive charging a "useful" addition to the iPhone lineup.[38]

David Pierce of Wired similarly stated that the iPhone 8 models were overshadowed by the iPhone X, despite calling them "virtually perfect phones". Pierce praised performance, cameras, and displays, while repeatedly criticizing the "outdated" design.[39]

Nilay Patel of The Verge called the iPhone 8 the "default option", noting that the 8 models stand as almost universally overlooked by Apple's other new iPhone launched, the iPhone X. He nevertheless praised the device's form factor for being easy and non-slippery to hold and the display's addition of True Tone technology and upgraded speakers, though he cited issues with inductive charging speed through wireless pads as well as the price of the iPhone 8 Plus 256 GB, which was close to that of the iPhone X. Patel also criticized the iPhone 8's aging design, dating back to the iPhone 6 released in 2014; the most notable critique was of the thick bezels when compared to other 2017 smartphones, designed with nearly bezel-less faces to incorporate larger screens in a similar form factor.[40]

The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus were also criticized for their durability, as drop tests performed showed that the rear glass is not "the most durable glass ever in a smartphone", as claimed by Apple.[41][42]

Camera testing company DxOMark gave the camera on the iPhone 8 a rating of 92 and 8 Plus a rating of 94, giving them the title of best smartphone cameras tested by the company.[43][44] The Samsung Galaxy Note 8 later matched the iPhone 8 Plus with an identical overall score of 94.[45][46] They were later overtaken by the Google Pixel 2, which scored a 98 rating.[47]

Although being the first mobile phone to record 2160p at 60 frames per second, the iPhone 8, 8 Plus and X have been criticized in a review by GSMArena for its mono (single-channel) audio recording for videos, while stereo audio recording for videos has been available on competing mobile phone models for several years, such as the Samsung Galaxy S3 and Sony Xperia S from 2012.[28][48][49]

On August 31, 2018, Apple announced that a "very small percentage" of iPhone 8 devices released between September 2017 and March 2018 contained a manufacturing defect in the logic board. This fault affected iPhone 8 models sold in Australia, China, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Macau, New Zealand, and the United States. Defective devices may experience unexpected reboots, a frozen or unresponsive screen, or may fail to turn on. Users with an affected device, as determined by their serial number, can have their device replaced for free by Apple. This issue does not affect the iPhone 8 Plus.[50][51]

List of iPhone models

The iPhone 11 is a smartphone developed and marketed by Apple Inc. It is the thirteenth generation of iPhone, succeeding the iPhone XR, and was unveiled on September 10, 2019, alongside the higher-end iPhone 11 Pro at the Steve Jobs Theater in Apple Park, Cupertino, by Apple CEO Tim Cook. Preorders began on September 13, 2019, and the phone was officially released on September 20, 2019, one day after the official public release of iOS 13.

Despite minimal exterior changes from the preceding iPhone XR, substantial design changes within the phone took place, including the addition of the more powerful Apple A13 Bionic chip as well as an ultra-wide dual-camera system.[9] In October 2020, Apple halted the inclusion of both Apple EarPods and the wall adapter, citing environmental goals.[10][11]

As of March 2022[update], the iPhone 11 has sold 159.2 million units worldwide, making it the tenth best-selling smartphone of all time.[12][13]

The iPhone 11 as well as the iPhone 12 mini and iPhone 13 Pro with its Max variant were discontinued and removed from Apple's website after the announcement of the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro on September 7, 2022.


History
--------------------------------------------------
Details regarding the smartphone were widely leaked before the official release; complete specifications and renderings of the phone were widely publicized. Among the most significant changes were improvements in the cameras and the continuation of the 'notch' design around the frontal camera which dipped down into the screen, a feature started by the iPhone X.[14][15][16] The official event invite which was sent out to developers contained a graphic featuring an Apple logo made of layered colored glass, implied to be the new colors for the phone. A patent filed by Apple earlier in the year also hinted at a new camera design.[17][18]


Design
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 11 was available in six colors: Purple, Yellow, Green, Black, White and Product (Red). The top of the screen retains the 'notch' design, wherein the TrueDepth camera system and phone speaker are encapsulated in a black, rounded-out rectangle that dips into the screen, similar to its predecessor, the iPhone XR. An elevated area in the top corner on the back of the iPhone acts as a camera housing, containing the microphone, the flashlight, and both of the rear-facing digital cameras.[11][19] The Apple logo on the back of the phone is centered to be equidistant to all edges and is made of a reflective material.


Specifications
--------------------------------------------------

Hardware
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 11, along with the iPhone 11 Pro, uses Apple's A13 Bionic processor, which contains a third-generation neural engine. It has three internal storage options: 64 GB, 128 GB, and 256 GB.[20] It also has 4 GB of RAM.[21] The iPhone 11 has an IP68 water- and dust-resistant rating along with dirt and grime, and is water-resistant up to 2 m (6.6 ft) for 30 minutes. However, the manufacturer's warranty does not cover liquid damage to the phone. Also, like previous iPhones, both phones do not have a headphone jack, and initially came with wired EarPods with a Lightning connector, although Apple no longer includes these with any device.[11][21] The iPhone 11 is the first smartphone with built-in ultra wideband hardware, via its Apple U1 chip.[22][23][24]


Display
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 11 has a 6.1-inch (15 cm) IPS LCD with a resolution of 1792 × 828 pixels (1.4 megapixels) at a pixel density of 326 PPI with a maximum brightness of 625 nits and a 1400:1 contrast ratio and it is equivalent to the iPhone XR. It supports Dolby Vision, HDR10, True-Tone, and a wide color gamut. As with the iPhone 11 Pro, XR, XS, and X, the display has a notch at the top for the TrueDepth camera system and the speaker. The display has an oleophobic coating, making it fingerprint-resistant.[2][21] Apple announced in September 2019 that both the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro would show a warning notification if a display were replaced with an unauthorized part. Apple stated that problems with the phone could arise if the wrong parts or procedures were used during the repair process.[25]


Battery
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 11 is supplied with a 11.91 Wh (3,110 mAh) battery, a slight increase from the 11.21 Wh (2,942 mAh) found in the iPhone XR. The battery is not user-replaceable.


Camera
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 11 includes a dual-lens 12 MP rear camera array. It has one ƒ/2.4 ultra-wide-angle lens with a 120° field of view and 2× optical zoom out, and one ƒ/1.8 wide-angle lens. The iPhone 11 supports 4K video at up to 60 fps and 1080p slow motion at up to 240 fps.[2] The phone also features an audio zoom feature, which focuses audio on the area on which is being zoomed in, similar to the Pro model.[21] Both of the cameras support video, although only the primary lens has OIS. It supports portrait mode with six portrait lighting effects, depth control, and an advanced bokeh effect. The phone also has an automatic night mode allowing the camera to take brighter pictures with reduced noise in low-light environments. Also, a redesigned camera app adds new features such as a scroll wheel for choosing between the different lenses and a feature called "QuickTake", which allows the user to long-press the shutter button to take a video. Apple has also announced a new Deep Fusion feature that takes advantage of AI and machine learning for image processing and was released via iOS 13.2 software update on October 29, 2019.[2][21][26]


Software
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 11 was supplied with iOS 13,[27] which includes Siri, Face ID (through the TrueDepth camera), Apple Pay, and Apple Card support. It received iOS 14 on September 16, 2020, iOS 15 on September 20, 2021, iOS 16 on September 12, 2022, iOS 17 on September 18, 2023.[28] and iOS 18 on September 16, 2024.[29]


Reception
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 11 drew generally positive reviews after its launch.[27][30] Reviews generally praised the phone's performance, battery life, and cameras, while criticizing the display as passable, but aging quickly. Reviewers also criticized the notch as being far too large for 2019. According to Counterpoint Research's Market Pulse, it was the second best-selling and the most popular model globally for 2019, in less than four months of launch.[31]


Controversy
--------------------------------------------------

Removal of the power adapter and EarPods
--------------------------------------------------
Apple, through an environmental initiative, has removed the EarPods and power adapter from new iPhone boxes starting October 2020, including the iPhone 11. Removing these items is claimed to reduce e-waste and permit a smaller iPhone box, allowing more devices to be transported simultaneously to decrease carbon footprint. However, Apple now includes a USB-C to Lightning cable, incompatible with the existing USB-A power adapters that Apple previously supplied with their devices. Upgraders can still use their existing iPhone power adapters and cables, but users wanting fast charging capabilities will have to purchase a USB-C power adapter separately.[32]

List of iPhone models

The iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini (stylized as iPhone 13 mini) are smartphones developed and marketed by Apple. They are the fifteenth generation of iPhones, succeeding the iPhone 12 and 12 Mini. They were unveiled at an Apple Event in Apple Park in Cupertino, California, on September 14, 2021, alongside the higher-priced iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max flagships. They were released on September 24, 2021.[12][13]

The iPhone 13 Mini was discontinued in September 2023, and the iPhone 13 was discontinued in September 2024 with the announcement of the iPhone 16.


History
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini were officially announced alongside the ninth-generation iPad, 6th generation iPad Mini, Apple Watch Series 7, iPhone 13 Pro, and iPhone 13 Pro Max by a virtual press event filmed and recorded at Apple Park in Cupertino, California, on September 14, 2021. Pre-orders began on September 17, 2021, at 5:00 am PDT. Pricing starts at US$799 for the iPhone 13 and US$699 for the iPhone 13 Mini.[14]

Together with iPhone 12, the iPhone 13 Mini was discontinued on September 12, 2023, with the announcement of the iPhone 15 and 15 Pro. The iPhone 13 continues to be sold until the announcement of the iPhone 16 and 16 Pro on September 9, 2024, when it was discontinued alongside the iPhone 15 Pro.


Design
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 13 has a flat chassis analogous to that of contemporaneous Apple products with some differences such as the rear cameras being larger and arranged diagonally. The Face ID True Depth sensor housing on the iPhone is 20% smaller yet taller than its predecessors.[15]

The iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini are available in six colors: Midnight, Starlight, Product Red, Blue, Pink, and Green.[16][17]

On March 8, 2022, at Apple's Special Event "Peek Performance", Apple revealed a new Green color option, which became available and released on March 18, 2022. [16][17]


Specifications
--------------------------------------------------

Hardware
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini use an Apple-designed A15 Bionic system on a chip. The iPhone 13 and 13 Mini feature a 6-core CPU, 4-core GPU, and 16-core Neural Engine, while the iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max feature a 5-core GPU.[18]


Display
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 13 features a 6.1-inch (155 mm) display with Super Retina XDR OLED technology at a resolution of 2532×1170 pixels and a pixel density of about 460 PPI with a refresh rate of 60 Hz. The iPhone 13 Mini features a 5.4-inch (137 mm) display with the same technology at a resolution of 2340×1080 pixels and a pixel density of about 476 PPI. Both models have the Super Retina XDR OLED display with improved typical brightness up to 800 nits, and max brightness up to 1200 nits.[19]


Cameras
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 13 and 13 Mini feature the same camera system with three cameras: one front-facing camera (12MP f/2.2) and two back-facing cameras: a wide (12MP f/1.6) and ultra-wide (12MP f/2.4) camera. The back-facing cameras both contain larger sensors for more light-gathering with new sensor shift optical image stabilization (OIS) on the main camera. The camera module on the back is arranged diagonally instead of vertically to engineer the larger sensors.[3]

The cameras use Apple's latest computational photography engine, called Smart HDR 4. Users can also choose from a range of photographic styles during capture, including rich contrast, vibrant, warm, and cool. Apple clarifies this is different from a filter because it works intelligently with the image processing algorithm during capture to apply local adjustments to an image and the effects will be baked into the photos, unlike filters which can be removed after applying.[3]

The camera app contains a new mode called Cinematic Mode, which allows users to rack focus between subjects and create (simulate) shallow depth of field using software algorithms. It is supported on wide and front-facing cameras in 1080p at 30 fps.[3]


Charging
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 13 and 13 Mini have Lightning fast charging at 20 Watts, and wireless charging via MagSafe at 15 W (iPhone 13) or 12 W (13 Mini), or via the Qi protocol at 7.5 W.


Software
--------------------------------------------------
iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini were originally shipped with iOS 15 at launch.[20] They are compatible with iOS 16, which was released on September 12, 2022. The latest software iOS 17, which was revealed at Apple's WWDC 2023 event, is compatible with the iPhone 13 and 13 Mini.[21] The next-generation Qi2 wireless charging standard has been added to the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini with the update to iOS 17.2.[22] It is compatible with iOS 18, which was released on September 16, 2024.[23]

The 13 and 13 Mini are able to make calls via: FaceTime Audio / Video (not available in some regions); Voice over LTE (VoLTE); Wi-Fi Calling (not available in some regions models). Wi-Fi hotspotting is also possible


Repairability
--------------------------------------------------
Some iPhone 13 parts are paired to the motherboard. The user is warned if a paired component (e.g. screen, battery) is replaced by independent repair shops, and the Face ID sensors may completely cease to function if replaced. On later iOS versions Apple removed this limitation. Apple technicians have a proprietary software tool to pair components.[24][25]

List of iPhone models

The iPhone 4 is a smartphone that was developed and marketed by Apple Inc. It is the fourth generation of the iPhone lineup, succeeding the iPhone 3GS and preceding the iPhone 4s. Following a number of notable leaks, the iPhone 4 was first unveiled on June 7, 2010, at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco,[7] and was released on June 24, 2010, in the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Japan.

The iPhone 4 introduced a new hardware design to the iPhone family, which Apple's CEO Steve Jobs touted as the thinnest smartphone in the world at the time; it consisted of a stainless steel frame which doubled as an antenna, with internal components situated between two panels of aluminosilicate glass.[8] The iPhone 4 introduced Apple's new high-resolution "Retina display" (with a pixel density of 326 pixels per inch), while maintaining the same physical size and aspect ratio as its precursors, Apple's A4 system-on-chip, along with iOS 4—which notably introduced multitasking functionality and app folders. It was the first iPhone at the time to include a front-facing camera, which made possible Apple's new FaceTime video chat service, and the first to be released in a version for CDMA networks, ending AT&T's period as the exclusive carrier of iPhone products in the United States.

The iPhone 4 received a largely positive reception, with critics praising its revamped design and more powerful hardware, in comparison to previous models. While it was a market success (with over 600,000 pre-orders within 24 hours), the release of the iPhone 4 was plagued by highly publicized reports concerning abnormalities in its new antenna design that caused the device to lose its cellular signal if held in a certain way. Most direct contact with the phone's outer edge would cause a significant decrease in signal strength. Apple released iOS 4.0.1 to try to fix these issues, but were unsuccessful.[9]

The iPhone 4 spent the longest time as Apple's flagship iPhone model at fifteen months. Although the succeeding 4S was announced in October 2011, the 4 continued to be sold as a midrange model until September 2012, and thereafter as the entry-level offering in Apple's lineup until September 2013 with the announcement of the iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c. The iPhone 4 had one of the longest lifespans of any iPhone ever produced, spanning close to four years and available in some developing countries until early 2015.


History
--------------------------------------------------

Prototypes
--------------------------------------------------
Before the official unveiling of the iPhone 4 on June 7, 2010, two prototypes were brought to the attention of the media, breaching Apple's normally secretive development process. Many of the speculations regarding technical specifications proved accurate.


Engadget leak
--------------------------------------------------
On January 27, 2010, gadget website Engadget received leaked images of the unreleased first-generation iPad.[10] Unbeknownst to the editors and readers, these images contained two unreleased iPhone 4 models.[11] It wasn't until the subsequent Gizmodo release that they were aware of the complete contents of the images.[12]


Gizmodo leak
--------------------------------------------------
On April 19, 2010, gadget website Gizmodo reported that they had purchased an iPhone prototype for $5000, and furthermore, had conducted a product teardown of the device. The prototype was reported to have been lost by an Apple employee, Gray Powell, in Redwood City, California.[13] Shortly after Gizmodo published detailed information about the prototype, Apple's legal associates formally requested for the phone to be returned to Apple, and Gizmodo responded with the intent to cooperate.[14]

On April 23, officers from the Rapid Enforcement Allied Computer Team (REACT) task force of the California HTTAP Program raided the home of Jason Chen, the Gizmodo editor responsible for reviewing the prototype, seizing all of his computers and hard drives.[15] The Electronic Frontier Foundation criticized the raid as violating journalist source protection laws that forbid the seizure of journalist computers, as well as the suspicion that Apple had used its influence as a member of the steering committee, which is charged with direction and oversight of the California REACT task force to push police into action in a way that would not normally be conducted for this type of incident. Apple had already received the iPhone prototype before the raid when it was returned by Gizmodo.[16] The District Attorney stated that the investigation was suspended, and discontinued searching through the Gizmodo editor's belongings as they determine whether the shield laws are applicable, and cautioned that no charges have been issued at this point.[17][18]


Taoviet leak
--------------------------------------------------
Pictures and video of a second prototype were published on a Vietnamese website, Taoviet, on May 12, 2010.[19] It was almost identical to the first, and used an A4 chip manufactured by Apple.[20] The website purchased the prototype for $4,000.[21] DigiTimes reported that the screen resolution of the new phone was 960-by-640, which was confirmed by Apple at the iPhone 4's official announcement.


Release
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 4 was available for pre-order on June 15, 2010.[22] Customers attempting to pre-order the iPhone 4 reported problems with the pre-order process on the US and UK online Apple Stores which crashed due to the surge in traffic.[23] The same issue was reported with AT&T and SoftBank, Apple's exclusive partners in the United States and Japan respectively, who suspended advance sales of the iPhone 4 as demand threatened to exceed supply.[24] Retail stores were also unable to complete pre-order transactions due to the servers crashing.[25]

Apple and its partner carriers received 600,000 pre-orders for the iPhone 4 in the first 24 hours, the largest number of pre-orders Apple had received in a single day for any device up to that point.[26] Engadget reported that at 20:30 UTC, all iPhone 4 pre-order suppliers had sold out.[27] 1.7 million iPhone 4 models were sold in its first three days of availability.[28]

The iPhone 4 was also released through Orange in Tunisia and was available in eight cities at the launch.[29] On July 30, 2010, iPhone 4 was made available for sale in Australia, New Zealand and 15 other countries with free bumper cases.[30][31] In South Korea, it was released by KT on September 10. In Israel, it was released, too, on September 24, through Cellcom, Pelephone and Orange. It was launched in Thailand on September 23 by AIS, DTAC and True Move, and in Malaysia on September 26 in Kuala Lumpur, and nationwide on September 27 according to the Malaysian service provider Maxis.

The iPhone 4 was released in South Africa on September 22 on the Vodacom and MTN networks, in very limited quantities.[32] The iPhone 4 was launched in Vietnam on September 30 on VinaPhone and Viettel, at first in three major cities: Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City and Da Nang, and then all over the country by the end of October.

The iPhone 4 was launched in India on May 27, 2011 by Aircel and Airtel.[33]

On January 11, 2011, Verizon Wireless announced during a media event that it had reached an agreement with Apple and would begin selling a CDMA iPhone 4 in the United States, ending Apple's exclusivity agreement with AT&T. The Verizon iPhone went on sale on February 10 and pre orders began on February 3.[34][35][36] The Verizon iPhone includes the 'Personal Hotspot" feature which allows a user to use the iPhone as a wireless hotspot, with up to five devices connecting at one time. The February 3, 2011, presale of the iPhone 4 broke Verizon's first day sales records for a single device.[37]

On June 24, 2010, Apple stated that the white iPhone 4 models were proving more "challenging to manufacture" than expected, and initially pushed the release date back to the second half of July.[38] There was a lot of speculation surrounding the delay of the white iPhone 4. Among the most popular rumours are those concerning the phone's internal camera being adversely affected by light leaking in due to the semi-translucent glass and the white paint.[39][40] Other sources report that the problem relates to Apple's inability to match the white colour of the front faceplate with that of the home button.[41] On April 27, 2011, Apple announced that it would be releasing the white iPhone 4 model on April 28, 2011, for both GSM and CDMA.[42] The release of the white iPhone 4 was carried out on April 28.[43][44]

During Apple's official unveiling of the iPhone 4s on October 4, 2011, it was announced that Sprint would begin carrying the CDMA iPhone 4 and the iPhone 4s in the US on October 14.[45][46]


Discontinuation
--------------------------------------------------
In September 2013, after the release of the iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c, Apple stopped selling the iPhone 4 in most of their stores as well as on their website. It was replaced by the 8 GB iPhone 4s.[47][48][49]


Hardware
--------------------------------------------------

Display
--------------------------------------------------
The display of the iPhone 4 was manufactured by LG under an exclusive contract with Apple. It features an LED backlit TFT LCD capacitive touchscreen with a pixel density of 326 pixels per inch (ppi) on a 3.5 in (8.9 cm) (diagonally measured), 960×640 display. Each pixel is 78 micrometers in width. The display has a contrast ratio of 800:1. The screen was marketed by Apple as the "Retina display", based on the assertion that a display of approximately 300 ppi at a distance of 305 millimetres (12 in) from one's eye, or 57 arcseconds per pixel,[50] is the maximum amount of detail that the human retina can perceive.[51] With the iPhone expected to be used at a distance of about 12 inches from the eyes, a higher resolution would allegedly have no effect on the image's apparent quality as the maximum potential of the human eye has already been met.

This claim was widely disputed. Raymond Soneira, president of DisplayMate Technologies, said in an interview with the Wired magazine, that his claims by Jobs are something of an exaggeration: "It is reasonably close to being a perfect display, but Steve pushed it a little too far". Soneira stated that the resolution of the human retina is higher than claimed by Apple, working out to 477 PPI at 12 inches (305 mm) from the eyes, or 36 arcseconds per pixel.[52]

However, Phil Plait, author of Bad Astronomy, whose career includes a collaboration with NASA regarding the camera on the Hubble Space Telescope, responded to the criticism by stating that "if you have [better than 20/20] eyesight, then at one foot away the iPhone 4's pixels are resolved. The picture will look pixellated. If you have average eyesight, the picture will look just fine".[53][54]


Camera
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 4 features an additional front-facing 640x480 camera, and a backside-illuminated 5 megapixel rear-facing camera with a 3.85 mm f/2.8 lens[55][1] and an LED flash. The rear-facing 5-megapixel camera is capable of recording HD video in 720p at 30 frames per second. Both cameras make use of the tap to focus feature, part of iOS 4, for photo and video recording.[56] The rear-facing camera has a 5× digital zoom.


Connectivity
--------------------------------------------------
In contrast to Steve Jobs' announcement at WWDC 2010, Federal Communications Commission documentation showed that, in fact, the iPhone 4 contains a penta-band 3G UMTS antenna, not a quad-band 3G UMTS radio, as advertised by Apple [citation needed]. According to the FCC documentation filed by Apple, the radio inside the iPhone 4 supports 800, 850, 900, 1,900, and 2,100 MHz. The 800 MHz frequency, which is most commonly used in Japanese mobile phones, is not advertised as being supported by Apple.[57] However, the 800 MHz band is a subset of the 850 MHz band, which probably explains why the device was advertised as quad-band.[citation needed] The chip-sets were manufactured by Skyworks Solutions[58] and Infineon for GSM version.

As with most of Apple's mobile products at the time, the iPhone 4 also used the 30 pin dock connector as its only external data port.

The iPhone 4 is the first generation of iPhone to have a second microphone used for noise cancellation. It is located on the top of the unit near the headphone jack; the main microphone is on the bottom left.[59]


Gyroscope and accelerometer
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 4 introduces a gyroscopic sensor that detects 3-axis angular acceleration around the X, Y, and Z axes, enabling precise calculation of yaw, pitch, and roll. The gyroscope complements the accelerometer, a sensor that has been present since the original iPhone, which detects the device's acceleration, shake, vibration shock, or fall by detecting linear acceleration along with one of three axes (X, Y, and Z). The combined data from the accelerometer and the gyroscope provides detailed and precise information about the device's 6-axis movement in space. The 3 axes of the gyroscope combined with the 3 axes of the accelerometer enable the device to recognize approximately how far, fast, and in which direction it has moved in space.[60]


Processor, memory and storage
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 4 is powered by the Apple A4 chip, which was designed by Intrinsity[61] and, like all prior iPhone models, manufactured by Samsung.[62] This system-on-a-chip is composed of an ARM Cortex-A8 CPU integrated with a PowerVR SGX535 GPU.[63] The Apple A4 was also used in the first-generation iPad (released in 2010), where it was clocked at its rated speed of 1 GHz. The Apple A4 was the first ever mobile phone processor designed by Apple. The clock speed in the iPhone 4 was never disclosed. All prior models of the iPhone had underclocked the CPU, which typically extends battery life and lowers heat dissipation.

The iPhone 4 has 512 MB of DRAM. The additional DRAM supports increased performance and multi-tasking.[64] As on prior models, all data is stored in flash memory, 8, 16 or 32 GB, and not on the SIM. Unlike prior generations, the storage capacity is not printed on the back of the unit.


Micro-SIM
--------------------------------------------------
The GSM iPhone 4 uses a micro-SIM card, which is positioned in an ejectable tray, located on the right side of the device. The CDMA iPhone 4, however, the phone connects to the network using an ESN. All prior models have used regular mini-SIM cards. Depending on the operator, micro-SIM cards may not be available for all networks globally. As a technical workaround, it is possible to trim a mini-SIM card with a knife or scissors so that it fits into the micro-SIM tray.[65]


Design
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 4 features a redesigned structure, designed by Jony Ive, a design that would later be reused and adapted for the iPhone 4S, 5, 5S and first-generation iPhone SE. Most notably, the bulges of the back panel as well as the band between the front and back are gone and have been replaced with flattened surfaces. The redesign reflects the utilitarianism and uniformity of existing Apple products, such as the iPad and the iMac. The overall dimensions of the iPhone 4 have been reduced from their predecessor.[66]

It is 115 millimetres (4.5 in) high, 58.6 millimetres (2.31 in) wide, and 9.4 millimetres (0.37 in) deep, compared to the iPhone 3GS, which is 116 millimetres (4.6 in) high, 62 millimetres (2.4 in) wide, and 12 millimetres (0.47 in) deep; making the iPhone 4 24% thinner than its predecessor, the iPhone 3GS. Steve Jobs claimed it to be "the thinnest smartphone on the planet."[66] The reduced size of the device is primarily due to the externally placed antenna.

The iPhone 4 is structured around a stainless steel frame that wraps around the edge of the phone, acting both as the primary structure for the device and as the iPhone 4's antennas. This metal band features two slits on the GSM version of the phone, one at the lower left, and one at the top (and a fake slit along the lower right, to cosmetically mirror the one at the lower left) that divide the band into two antenna sections: the left section of the band serves as the Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and GPS antenna, and the right and lower sections of the band act as the antenna for GSM and UMTS connectivity.

On the CDMA version of the phone, there are four slits in the metal band. Two at the top (on the left and right) and two at the bottom. This divides the metal band into four different segments, which like the GSM version of the phone, serve as different antennas for connectivity. The top portion of the band (divided by the top left and right slits) is for connecting to the CDMA network. The left portion of the metal band is for Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and GPS just like the GSM version. The right side is not an antenna but serves to cosmetically mirror the left side and also to create a similar look to the GSM version of the phone.

The internal components are situated between two panels of aluminosilicate glass, described by Apple as being "chemically strengthened to be 20 times stiffer and 30 times harder than plastic," theoretically allowing it to be more scratch-resistant and durable than the prior models.[8]

In fall 2010, pentalobe screws started to replace the Philips screws used in post-repair units in the US and in production units in Japan.[67]


Software
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 4 shipped with iOS 4, which was the newest version of Apple's iOS mobile operating system at the time. iOS 4 introduced a multitasking system, allowing apps to remain "suspended" in memory, perform certain operations in the background, and allowing users to switch between apps using an on-screen menu.[68] It also introduced FaceTime, which allows users to perform video calls between other iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, and Mac OS X users.

The iPhone 4 supports up to iOS 7, released in September 2013. Due to the relatively aged hardware of the iPhone 4, most features available on newer iPhone models are not available on the device; as of iOS 7, they include Siri, 3D maps and turn-by-turn navigation, AirDrop, AirPlay mirroring, live camera filters, panorama mode and certain visual effects introduced by iOS 7, such as the blurring of translucent interface elements, the parallax effect on the home screen, and live wallpapers.[69] While still subject to the same limitations, iOS 7.1 did bring some slight performance improvements to the operating system on the iPhone 4. iOS 7, specifically iOS 7.1.2, is the last version of iOS to support the iPhone 4. Unlike the iPhone 4s, the iPhone 4 did not receive the iOS 8 update due to performance issues.[70][71]


Accessories
--------------------------------------------------

Bumper
--------------------------------------------------
Apple released a plastic and rubber case called the Bumper to protect the edges of the phone. The case, which also provided some screen protection, included buttons and holes that enabled switch and connector access.[72]

Apple updated the bumper with a wider volume switch hole with the release of the iPhone 4 for CDMA networks. The updated bumper is also compatible with iPhone 4s, the next-generation iPhone that has the same exterior design and measurements as the CDMA model of the iPhone 4, but with a SIM card slot as well.


Reception
--------------------------------------------------

Pre-release
--------------------------------------------------
Pre-release reception was largely positive.[73] The announcement included information that had not been covered by Gizmodo. Fox News commented that "seeing it in action is far more informative than staring at Gizmodo's photos of a busted test unit".[74] Rhodri Marsden of The Independent said that "aside from the introduction of face-to-face video calling, it's not a staggering feature set," instead focusing on how the device is "more powerful than its predecessor, speedier, easier to use and will make previously laborious tasks seem like a cinch".[75]

CNET reacted to the announcement by explaining how it believes that iMovie for iOS was the "most exciting part of this year's WWDC Keynote". The article noted how the iPhone 4, unlike current cameras, can record HD content and then edit it from the same device, labeling it a "true mobile editing suite".[76]


Reviews
--------------------------------------------------
Reviews of the iPhone 4 were largely positive. Walt Mossberg of The Wall Street Journal called the device "the best device in its class".[77] Engadget named it the "best smartphone on the market" in June 2010.[78] CNET gave the iPhone 4 a rating of 8.6 out of 10, one of the highest ratings it had given any smartphone.[79] TechRadar gave the device 4.5/5 stars.[80] Consumer Reports said the signal problem was the reason they did not rate it a "recommended" model, although the other tests ranked it highest among smartphones.[81]

Joshua Topolsky of Engadget described the device's industrial design as being "more detailed and sophisticated" than its predecessor.[78]


Technical problems
--------------------------------------------------
Some users reported a yellow discoloration of the screen that disappeared after several days, which was attributed to the glass lamination glue that was used. It did not have time to dry fully before the unit reached consumers due to the speed of manufacturing.[82] Another issue reported by some users within days of the iPhone 4 release was that during calls the proximity sensor can be insensitive, so that facial contact with the touchscreen can end calls, mute calls, and dial other numbers.[83] Some users reported that, particularly in low-light conditions, photos taken on the iPhone 4 sometimes contained blue or green "splotches." Issues with white balance were also discovered, particularly when using the flash.[84][85]


Antenna
--------------------------------------------------
Shortly after the iPhone 4 was launched, some users reported that signal strength of the phone was reduced when touching the lower left edge of the phone, bridging one of the two locations which separates the two antennas, resulting in dropped calls in some areas with lower signal reception.[86][87][88] In response, Apple issued a statement advising that customers should "avoid gripping [the phone] in the lower left corner" when making or receiving a call.[89] Internally, senior antenna expert Ruben Caballero raised concerns to CEO Steve Jobs that the antenna design could lead to dropped calls.[90]

As a consequence of this problem, it was reported on July 2, 2010 that several iPhone 4 users were planning on suing Apple and AT&T for fraud by concealment, negligence, intentional misrepresentation and defective design. The legal challenge was started by a law firm, who set up a website to recruit disenchanted iPhone 4 buyers for a lawsuit against Apple.[91][92] Later that day, Apple issued another statement stating that it had discovered the cause of the "dramatic drop in bars".[93]

Apple explained how the formula it used to calculate the number of bars to display was "totally wrong". Apple promised to correct the issue and release a software update within a few weeks that would address the "mistake", which had been present since the original iPhone.[93] The New York Times commented that "the failure to detect this longstanding problem earlier is astonishing."[94]

Consumer Reports initially stated that the iPhone 4's signal issues are not "unique, and may not be serious" and it continued to mention that signal loss is a problem that is faced by the entire smartphone industry. It was such a problem that Apple made a formal apology onstage. The next day, the magazine altered their stance after encountering instances of dropped calls.[95] The magazine rejected Apple's explanation after conducting tests in a controlled environment, and comparing the results against prior generations of iPhone. It sarcastically pointed out that using a piece of tape to cover the lower left antenna gap was one way to fix the problem, but recommended that consumers who "want an iPhone that works well without a masking-tape fix" purchase the iPhone 3GS instead.[81] The magazine also tested the iPhone 4 while it was wearing a Bumper, a frame-like cover sold by Apple that prevents direct contact with the antenna, reporting that it did resolve the problem.[96] CNN repeated Consumer Reports' statement that a small amount of duct tape had proven an effective fix to the iPhone 4's dropped call issue.[97]

On July 16, 2010, at a press conference which included a private tour of Apple's antenna design lab for journalists,[98] Steve Jobs announced that Apple would provide all iPhone 4 owners with a free case to help solve the antenna issue and a refund to those users who had already purchased a Bumper. The free case offer would be valid until September 30, 2010, when Apple would re-evaluate the situation.[99][100] To get a free case, owners were able to apply via an app installed on the phone found in the App Store from July 22, 2010 to September 30, 2010. Jobs also announced that Apple could not produce enough Bumpers for all owners of the phone, but would source a supply and offer a range of cases.[101] Additionally, Jobs cited figures from AppleCare which showed that only 0.55 percent of all iPhone 4 users have complained to the company about the issue, while the number of phones returned to Apple was 1.7 percent – 4.3 percentage points less than the number of iPhone 3GS models that were returned in the first month of the phone's launch.[101]

Consumer Reports noted that the solution was not permanent, though a good first step.[102] However, because Jobs did not specify a time line for fixing the problem, and the offering for a free bumper only being a temporary solution, PC World decided to remove the iPhone 4 from its "Top 10 Cell Phones" chart and reassign it to a pending rating.[103]

Despite the negative media attention regarding the antenna issues, 72% of iPhone 4 users said that they were "very satisfied" with their iPhone 4 according to an August 2010 survey by ChangeWave Research.[104] The GSM iPhone 4 continued to be sold unchanged until its discontinuation in September 2013, while the CDMA iPhone 4 and all models of the iPhone 4S featured a tweaked antenna design to prevent the issue from happening.


iPhones in space
--------------------------------------------------
In 2011, two iPhone 4 units equipped with a special application were taken to the International Space Station aboard the Space Shuttle on the STS-135 mission.[105] The devices were used in various experiments, utilizing sensors and a special app.[105]

List of iPhone models

The iPhone 5 is a smartphone that was developed and marketed by Apple Inc. It is the 6th generation iPhone, succeeding the iPhone 4s, and preceding both the iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c. It was formally unveiled as part of a press event on September 12, 2012, and subsequently released on September 21, 2012. The iPhone 5 was the first iPhone to be announced in September, and setting a trend for subsequent iPhone releases, the first iPhone to be completely developed under the guidance of Tim Cook and the last iPhone to be overseen by Steve Jobs. The iPhone 5's design was used three times, first with the iPhone 5 itself in 2012, then with the iPhone 5s in 2013, and finally with the first-generation iPhone SE in 2016.

The iPhone 5 featured major design changes in comparison to its predecessor. These included an aluminum-based body which was thinner and lighter than previous models, a taller 4-inch screen with a nearly 16:9 aspect ratio, the Apple A6 system-on-chip, LTE support, and Lightning, a new compact dock connector which replaced the 30-pin design used by previous iPhone models. This was the second iPhone after the iPhone 4s to include Apple's new Sony-made 8 MP camera.

Apple began taking pre-orders on September 14, 2012, and over two million were received within 24 hours. Initial demand for the iPhone 5 exceeded the supply available at launch on September 21, 2012, and was described by Apple as "extraordinary", with pre-orders having sold twenty times faster than its predecessors. While reception to the iPhone 5 was generally positive, consumers and reviewers noted hardware issues, such as an unintended purple hue in photos taken, and the phone's coating being prone to chipping. Reception was also mixed over Apple's decision to switch to a different dock connector design, as the change affected iPhone 5's compatibility with accessories that were otherwise compatible with previous iterations of the line.

The iPhone 5 was officially discontinued by Apple on September 10, 2013, with the announcement of its successors, the iPhone 5s and the iPhone 5c. The iPhone 5 has the joint second-shortest lifespan of any iPhone ever produced with only twelve months in production, breaking with Apple's standard practice of selling an existing iPhone model at a reduced price upon the release of a new model. This was broken by the iPhone X which only had ten-months in production from November 2017 to September 2018, and tied with the iPhone XS which had twelve-months from September 2018 to September 2019.

It was replaced as a midrange and then an entry-level device by the iPhone 5c; the 5c internal hardware specifications are almost identical to the 5 albeit having a less expensive polycarbonate exterior shell. The iPhone 5 supports iOS 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10. The iPhone 5 does not support iOS 11 due to it dropping support for 32-bit devices. The iPhone 5 is the second iPhone to support five major versions of iOS after the iPhone 4s.


History
--------------------------------------------------
Rumors about the iPhone 5 began shortly after the announcement of the iPhone 4s, though detailed leaks did not emerge until June 2012.[12] On July 30, 2012, reports pinpointed the dates on which the iPhone 5 would be unveiled and released, along with some accurate predictions of its features.[13] On September 4, 2012, Apple announced they would be hosting an event at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco on September 12, 2012. A shadow of the numeral 5 was featured in the invitations sent to the media, suggesting that the next iPhone would be unveiled at the event.[14]

At the unveiling, Apple announced the iPhone 5 and also introduced new iPod Nano and iPod Touch models. They also stated that pre-orders would be accepted starting September 14, 2012.[1][15] Over two million pre-orders were received within 24 hours.[5][16] The iPhone 5 was made available for sale to the public on September 21, 2012.[17] Initial demand for the new phone exceeded the record set by its predecessor, the iPhone 4s, by selling over 5 million units in the first three days.[18] On November 30, 2012, Apple added an unlocked version of the iPhone 5 to their online US store, with the 16 GB model starting at US$649.[19][20]

The iPhone 5 was officially discontinued by Apple on September 10, 2013, with the announcement of its successors, the iPhone 5s and the iPhone 5c.[21] While the 5c shared almost the same internal hardware as the iPhone 5, the 5c used a lower-cost polycarbonate plastic case in place of the original 5's aluminum form. The introduction of the 5c deviated from Apple's previous market strategy, where the previous iPhone model would remain in production, but sold at a lower price point below the new model.[21]

On April 28, 2014, Apple initiated an out of warranty recall program to replace any failing power buttons of iPhone 5 models which were manufactured prior to March 2013 at no cost.[22] On August 23, 2014, Apple announced a program to replace batteries of iPhone 5 models that "may suddenly experience shorter battery life or need to be charged more frequently" which were sold between September 2012 and January 2013.[23][24]


Litigation
--------------------------------------------------
Following the release of the iPhone 5, Samsung announced that it was filing a lawsuit against Apple for infringing eight of its patents. The case was scheduled to begin in 2014.[25] In a statement, Samsung said it had "little choice but to take the steps necessary to protect our innovations and intellectual property rights".[26] Litigation between the two involving patent infringement has been ongoing and is being fought in several court cases around the world.[27]


Production
--------------------------------------------------
The components and labor required to construct the most basic iPhone 5 are estimated to cost US$207, which is US$19 more than the cost of components for the corresponding iPhone 4s model. The LTE module in the iPhone 5 alone costs $34, $10 more than the cellular module in the iPhone 4s. Similarly, screens used in the iPhone 5 cost $44, which is $7 more than the screen of its predecessor. Mashable noted that the profit margin of selling each device is "huge" as the iPhone 5 retails for US$649.[28][29]

After the announcement of the device, a lack of supply was evident. This was due to a shortage of components such as the screen. Reports emerged, stating that Sharp was unable to ship the screen before the debut of the iPhone 5, and other manufacturers reported that it was difficult to keep up with demand. As a result, the number of pre-orders rose due to the uncertainty of stock at retail stores, and the delivery dates for pre-orders were postponed to dates that were after the initial release date of the device.[30]


Quality control inspectors strike
--------------------------------------------------
China Labor Watch, a New York State–based NGO, reported that "three to four thousand" Foxconn workers who work at the iPhone 5 production plant in Zhengzhou stopped working on October 5, 2012.[31] The strikes occurred after Apple implemented a stricter quality standard on their products, which includes a 0.02 mm restriction on indentations inflicted during production, and imposed demands related to scratches on frames and back covers.[31] The strikes were also attributed to the employer forcing employees to work on a public holiday. The report stated training was inadequate for quality demands expected and led to employees producing products that did not meet standards. During the strike, conflicts between quality control inspectors and employees resulted in brawls. China Labor Watch also claimed that concerns raised by inspectors were not addressed by factory management.[31] Foxconn spokesmen admitted that a micromanagement problem exists, but also said that there were only 300 to 400 workers absent and the conflicts did not influence production processes.[32] In November 2012 Foxconn chairman Terry Gou reported that the delay in production was due to undisclosed difficulties in assembly.[33]


Features
--------------------------------------------------

Operating system and software
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 5 features iOS, Apple's mobile operating system.[34] The user interface of iOS is based on the concept of direct manipulation, using multi-touch gestures. Interface control elements consist of sliders, switches, and buttons.[35] Interaction with the OS includes gestures such as swipe, tap, pinch, and reverse pinch, all of which have specific definitions within the context of the iOS operating system and its multi-touch interface. Internal accelerometers are used by some applications to respond to shaking the device (one common result is the undo command) or rotating it vertically (one common result is switching from portrait to landscape mode).[35]

The iPhone 5 is shipped with iOS 6, which was released on September 19, 2012.[34] Many of the iPhone 5's features that work specifically with the included iOS 6.0 operating system only worked in certain territories on release.[36] Apple has said this is a rolling program, which will take longer to implement across more regions.[37]

The phone can act as a hotspot, sharing its internet connection over WiFi, Bluetooth, or USB,[38] and also accesses the App Store, an online application distribution platform for iOS developed and maintained by Apple. The service allows users to browse and download applications from the iTunes Store that were developed with Xcode and the iOS SDK and were published through Apple.

The iPhone 5 can play music, movies, television shows, ebooks, audiobooks, and podcasts and can sort its media library by songs, artists, albums, videos, playlists, genres, composers, podcasts, audiobooks, and compilations. Options are always presented alphabetically, except in playlists, which retain their order from iTunes.[39] Users can rotate their device horizontally to landscape mode to access Cover Flow. Like on iTunes, this feature shows the different album covers in a scroll-through photo library. Scrolling is achieved by swiping a finger across the screen. Alternatively, headset controls can be used to pause, play, skip, and repeat tracks. On the iPhone 5, the volume can be changed with the included Apple Earphones, and the Voice Control feature can be used to identify a track, play songs in a playlist or by a specific artist, or create a Genius playlist.[39]

Like the iPhone 4s, the iPhone 5 has Siri,[39] that allows the user to operate the iPhone by spoken commands. The software was improved in iOS 6 to include the ability to make restaurant reservations, launch apps, dictate Facebook or Twitter updates, retrieve movie reviews and detailed sports statistics.[40]

On the iPhone 5, texting can be aided by the voice assistant, which converts speech to text.[39] In addition to regular texting, messaging on the iPhone 5 supports iMessage, a specialized instant messaging program and service that allows unlimited texting to other Apple devices running iOS 5 or later. This supports the inclusion of content such as images and sound in text messages, integration with the device's voice-controlled software assistant, and read acknowledgments for sent messages. Input to the device comes from a keyboard displayed on the multi-touch screen or by voice-to-text by speaking into the microphone. Entered text is supported by predictive and suggestion software; there is a multi-language spell-checker which recognizes many regional accents of different languages.[39]

iOS 6 features several new and/or updated apps, which includes Apple Maps and Passbook. Apple's built-in Maps app, which replaced the former Maps app powered by Google Maps, had been universally derided and lacked many features present in competing maps apps.[41][42] It uses Apple's new vector-based engine that eliminates lag, making for smoother zooming. New to Maps is turn-by-turn navigation spoken directions, 3D views in some major cities and real-time traffic.[40][43] iOS 6 is able to retrieve documents such as boarding passes, admission tickets, coupons and loyalty cards through its new Passbook app. An iOS device with Passbook can be scanned under a reader to process a mobile payment at locations that have compatible hardware. The app has context-aware features such as notifications for relevant coupons when in the immediate vicinity of a given store.[40][44]

Facebook comes integrated through Apple's native apps with iOS 6. Facebook features can be directly accessed from within native apps such as Calendar which can sync Facebook events, or use Facebook's like button from within the Apple App Store.[40]

New privacy settings are available to the user. In addition to location services, the following have been added in iOS 6: photos (already partially restricted in iOS 5), contacts (address book), calendars, reminders, Bluetooth sharing, Twitter, Facebook, and Sina Weibo. iOS 6 also comes with a "Limit ad tracking" user control in the general settings menu to allow users the option to prevent targeted advertising. Apple's Advertising Identifier replaces the company's existing Unique Device Identification (UDID) standard. Advertising networks not yet using Apple's Advertising Identifier device identifier standard would not be affected, although Apple will require the standard in the future.[45]


Design
--------------------------------------------------
Apple emphasized the improved build quality of the iPhone 5 at its press event.[15] The frame used in previous versions was redesigned to use an aluminum composite frame.[46] The iPhone 4 and iPhone 4s used stainless steel instead of aluminium due to Steve Jobs' preference for the metal which he thought, "looks beautiful when it wears".[47]

The iPhone 5 is 18% thinner, 20% lighter, and has 12% less overall volume than its predecessor, the iPhone 4s.[48] The phone's aluminum body is 0.30 in (7.6 mm) thick. At the September 2012 conference Apple claimed it was the thinnest smartphone in the world at 7.6 mm, though that claim was disputed as the Chinese Oppo Finder was thinner and some other smartphones could be considered to be thinner, depending upon where thickness is measured. The Oppo Finder measured 6.65 mm (0.262 in) at its thinnest point and 7.1 mm (0.28 in) at its thickest point making it overall thinner than the iPhone.[49][50][51][52] This design was used three times, first with the iPhone 5 in 2012, then with the 5s in 2013, and finally with the first-generation iPhone SE in 2016.


Hardware
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 5 uses a system on chip (SoC), called the Apple A6.[17][53][54] The SoC comprises a 1.3 GHz dual-core processor, 1 GB of RAM and a tri-core PowerVR SGX543MP4 running at 266 MHz.[55][56] The iPhone 5's operating memory (LPDDR2-1066 eDRAM) was doubled, from 512 MB to 1 GB. Storage capacities available are fixed at 16, 32 or 64 GB, the same as the 4s; plug-in memory cards are not supported.[57] The two color options are black (with black glass and slate-colored metal trim), and white (with white ceramic and silver-colored metal trim); again the same color options (though differently implemented) as its predecessor the 4s had.[58] The iPhone 5 retains the 8 megapixel back camera on the iPhone 4s, but has improved low-light performance, and has a 40% faster photo capture[59] than its predecessors, while having a purple hue when a strong source of light is present in the photograph.[60] The front camera, which is accessible through the FaceTime and camera app has a lower resolution, at 1.2 megapixels. The rechargeable lithium-ion battery with a charge capacity of 1440mAh[9] is built in and cannot be replaced by the user; it is rated at ≤225 hours of standby time and ≤8 hours of talk time. There are three separate models of the phone available: one supporting CDMA and two GSM versions.[61][62] This can have knock-on effects for which version of the device will actually work in which countries/regions.[citation needed] The phone takes a nano-SIM, smaller than the micro-SIM of the iPhone 4 and iPhone 4s.[63]

Hardware benchmarking conducted using Geekbench and GLBenchmark validates several claims that Apple included on their website and mentioned at the unveiling of the device, these include two times faster and two times the graphics performance. In the Geekbench overall hardware assessment, the iPhone 5 received a score that was approximately 2.5 times higher than the iPhone 4s. The benchmark conducted using GLBenchmark for the iPhone 5 returned a score that was 2 times better than the iPhone 4s. The result was however inconsistent as a 3D graphics benchmark assessment using Passmark returned a score that was only approximately 1.45 times better than the iPhone 4s.[64][65] Battery life assessments conducted by AnandTech concluded that the battery life is shorter on the iPhone 5 than its predecessor when performing certain tasks, however when performing other tasks the iPhone 5 battery outlasts the iPhone 4s.[66]

The Retina Display is 1,136 × 640 pixels with an aspect ratio of almost exactly 16:9, (minus one extra row of horizontal pixels). With a diagonal of 4" it has a display size of 6.7 square inches, compared to 5.7 in iPhone 4 and 4s.[67] The pixel density remains the same as the 4s model, which is 326 pixels per inch. Screen icons of the iPhone 5 are arranged in a matrix of six rows of four icons each. The increased screen size allows the sixth row of icons to be added to the five rows that were present in the iPhone 4. In-cell touch sensor technology from Sharp slims the screen which allows for a thinner phone. The screen's color saturation is 44% greater than its predecessor.[68]

There are three microphones (placed on the front, side and back) for noise cancellation and video calls.[69]

On April 28, 2014, Apple initiated an out of warranty recall program to replace any failing power buttons of iPhone 5 models which were manufactured prior to March 2013 at no cost.[22]

On August 23, 2014, Apple announced a program to replace batteries of iPhone 5 models that "may suddenly experience shorter battery life or need to be charged more frequently" which were sold between September 2012 and January 2013.[23][24]


Accessories
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 5, as well as the iPod Touch (5th generation), iPod Nano (7th generation), iPad (4th generation), and iPad Mini feature a new dock connector named Lightning, which replaces the 30-pin Apple Dock connector introduced in 2003 by Apple on the iPod (3rd generation). The Apple Lightning connector has eight pins and all signaling is digital. This new connector is smaller than the previous one, helping the iPhone 5 to be slimmer than its predecessors.[70] Apple Lightning cables have duplicate pins on two sides of each plug, so it can be inserted either way round. Various accessories will be available to convert the Apple Lightning connector to the older 30-pin Apple Dock connector or USB,[71] although not all old accessories will work, as not all signals are available, in particular video output and the iPod Out feature for BMW automobiles.[72][73][74]

Earphones known as Apple EarPods are included with the iPhone 5 and other devices announced at the Apple media event on September 12, 2012. They superseded earphones that were included with previous generation iPhones and iPods.[75] According to technology commentators, the redesign of the earphones is aimed to improve sound quality by allowing air to travel in and out more freely.[76][77] Apple states that the redesign of their earphones allows it to "rival high-end headphones that cost hundreds of dollars more".[76] Reviews by Gizmodo and TechRadar reported that although the redesigned earphones sounded better than its predecessor, reviewers felt that quality of sound produced is poor.[78]


Network compatibility
--------------------------------------------------
AT&T, Verizon, and Sprint offer LTE access in the US,[84] while in the UK, only EE and Three are able to offer LTE access.[85] On March 26, 2013, T-Mobile announced they would begin carrying the iPhone 5, making it the first iPhone to be available on all four nationwide carriers in the United States.[86] The T-Mobile version of the iPhone features a modified version of the A1428 iPhone 5 model enabling Advanced Wireless Services (AWS) support.[87] All carriers in Canada selling the iPhone 5 have their own LTE networks, including Rogers Wireless, Fido Solutions, Bell Mobility, Virgin Mobile Canada, Telus Mobility and Koodo Mobile.[88][89]

42 officially recognized bands exist for LTE, however rollouts are coalescing around the more-popular bands, based on what historically has been made available in specific regions. In Europe, bands available for LTE include, 2.6 GHz (the 3G-expansion band) and 800 MHz (cleared of analogue TV), with 1,800 MHz appearing in a few places including the UK. In Germany, the only carrier network supported is that of T-Mobile with its 1,800 MHz band allocated to LTE.[90][91] Some countries in Europe, including Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and others—will not be able to offer LTE connectivity via the iPhone 5 to their customers on their current LTE networks, as they have already deployed LTE in the 2.6 GHz band, which the iPhone 5 does not support.[92] In November 2012, a representative of Swisscom reported that the iPhone 5 only supports LTE on networks that have been tested and certified by Apple.[93][94]

Unlike the iPhone 4s, which was the only "world phone" produced by Apple, there are three versions of the iPhone 5, which differ by the frequency used. All three work on 2G GSM/GPRS and 3G UMTS/EDGE networks on both the 800 and 1900 MHz bands used in the Americas, and the 900 and 1800 MHz bands used elsewhere. The CDMA A1429 model works on CDMA networks, such as that of Sprint and Verizon. Another version supports LTE only on the 1700/2100 MHz AWS band, and the 700 MHz band recovered after the conversion to digital television in the US (channels 52 to 56), currently the only network that supports the band is AT&T. GSM A1429 supports several other LTE bands available in other countries, such as LTE bands 1, 3, 5.[62][95]


Reception
--------------------------------------------------

Critical reception
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 5 received mainly positive reviews from commentators and reviewers. Tim Stevens from Engadget praised the iPhone 5 for its high resolution screen surpassing that of the iPhone 4s, which he considered to be one of the best phone screens available on the market. Stevens was critical of the new connector, which is incompatible with devices and cables that use the superseded 30-pin connector, although the LA Times reported that this was a change necessary to make the device smaller than its predecessor.[70] Engadget agreed that Apple fulfilled most of the promises stated on its website, such as "better battery performance", "two times the graphics performance" and "two times faster."[96] David Pogue of The New York Times considered the 4-inch Retina display a "nice but not life-changing change", and praised the Lightning connector for its size, sturdiness, and reversibility, while noting its lack of support for older accessories, remarking that "Apple has a long history of killing off technologies, inconveniently and expensively, that the public had come to love".[97] Technology columnist Ed Baig of USA Today was impressed that Apple had met the public's "lofty expectations" for the iPhone 5 in a competitive market.[98] In a repair-ability review, iFixit found the iPhone 5 easier to disassemble and repair than its predecessor.[9][99]

Wired reported that the iPhone 5 design, carried on in the iPhone 5s and first-generation iPhone SE, was regarded as "long been the golden child of Apple phone design and a benchmark for phones in general", while the succeeding iPhone 6/6s design was less critically acclaimed as it "felt a little bit wrong, as though you were holding a slick $650 bar of soap". Wired described the iPhone 5 as "elegance rooted in the way the aluminum and glass work together. It felt streamlined, yet substantial, which is different from the iPhone 6, which feels substantial in size alone. Plus, unlike the ubiquitous rounded corners of the 6, the iPhone 5 didn't really look like anything else on the market at the time". However, the iPhone 5's design was not suited to scaling up, in contrast to the iPhone 6/6s which could better accommodate the growing consumer trend towards larger screen sizes and indeed spawned the 6/6S Plus phablet models.[100][101]


Criticism
--------------------------------------------------
Reviewers and commentators were critical of the new Maps app that replaced Google Maps in iOS 6. It had been reported to contain errors such as misplacement of landmark tags, directing users to incorrect locations and poor satellite images.[102][103][104] Nine days after Maps' release, Apple issued a statement apologizing for the frustration it had caused customers and recommending that they try alternate mapping services.[105]


Errors
--------------------------------------------------
Gizmodo editor Diaz discussed the correspondence between Apple and a reader about purple flare in pictures taken on iPhone 5 camera. Apple's response to the issue was that it is normal and advised the customer to aim the camera away from bright light sources when taking photos.[106] Tests conducted by TechCrunch indicate that the problem existed on the iPhone 4s but was more distinct and pronounced on the iPhone 5.[107] Consumer Reports found that the purple haze effect occurred on several other manufacturers' phones including the Samsung Galaxy S III and Motorola Droid Razr Maxx, and that it was not less pronounced on the iPhone 4s. The report concluded that digital cameras in general, including higher-end SLRs, can all suffer from lens flare in which a purple-tinted effect was not uncommon.[108]


Problems
--------------------------------------------------
There were anecdotal claims of the coating of primarily black iPhone 5s chipping off, exposing the bright aluminium underneath. Apple executive's response to email correspondence from an affected customer summarized that it was normal for aluminum to scratch.[109][110] The term "scuffgate", a reference to "antennagate" which affected the iPhone 4, was applied by various sources such as CNET, Yahoo News, and All Things Digital to describe the scuffing issue.[111][112]

Some users reported on the Internet that the white model leaked light behind the screen, though the issue was not unique to the iPhone 5, as it also affected other Apple devices.[113]


Commercial reception
--------------------------------------------------
Techcrunch reported that the iPhone 5 sold out twenty times faster than the 4 and 4s models. Apple said that they were "blown away by the customer response".[114] Phil Schiller, Apple's vice-president of worldwide marketing, said that over two million iPhone 5 orders had been received in the first 24 hours.[5][115] AT&T said that the iPhone 5 was the fastest-selling iPhone the company had ever offered, selling over five million units on launch weekend and exceeding the supply available.[6][116][117] The release and sale of the iPhone 5 has also slowed down the growth of Android according to market share reports released by Kantar Worldpanel ComTech.[118] During the first 16 days after the phone's initial release it comprised over 20% of all phones sold in that period.[119]

J.P. Morgan's chief economist, Michael Feroli said that "sales of iPhone 5 could boost annualized US GDP growth by $3.2 billion, or $12.8 billion at an annual rate."[120] Shortly after the announcement of the iPhone 5 and preceding the launch, Apple's stock price rose to a record $705.07,[121] but within three months fell to $507.48.[122] According to the analysis of Eric Savitz, Apple's stock decline and resulting losses were not the result of any issue with the new Maps application, but disappointed investors. He points to initial hardware sales of only five million, compared to projections up to twice that, as the primary cause.[123]

Since the release of the iPhone 5, discounts on previous generation iPhones have enabled Apple to maintain a market lead in the United States and Japan, but the iPhone continued to lag behind the combined total of Android phones in the global market.[124]

List of iPhone models

The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are smartphones that were developed and marketed by Apple Inc. They are the eighth generation of the iPhone, succeeding the iPhone 5, iPhone 5c and iPhone 5s, and were announced on September 9, 2014, and released on September 19, 2014.[20] The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus jointly were themselves replaced as the flagship devices of the iPhone series by the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus on September 9, 2015. The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus include larger 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch displays, a faster processor, upgraded cameras, improved LTE and Wi-Fi connectivity and support for a near-field communications-based mobile payments offering.[21][22]

The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus received positive reviews, with critics regarding their redesign, specifications, camera, and battery life as being improvements over previous iPhone models. However, aspects of the design of iPhone 6 were also criticized, including plastic strips on the rear of the device for its antenna that disrupted the otherwise metal exterior, and the screen resolution of the standard-sized iPhone 6 being lower than other devices in its class. The iPhone 6 sold extremely well, making it the best-selling iPhone model and the most successful smartphone to date.

The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus have been the subject of several hardware issues, including most prominently, being susceptible to bending under hard pressure (dubbed "Bendgate"), and as a byproduct of this lack of rigidity, the touchscreen's internal hardware being susceptible to losing its connection to the phone's logic board (nicknamed "Touch Disease"). Additionally, some iPhone 6 Plus models were the subject of camera issues, including some with malfunctioning optical image stabilization or otherwise defects on rear cameras.

The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were moved to the midrange spot in Apple's iPhone lineup when the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus were released in September 2015. The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were discontinued in most markets on September 7, 2016, when Apple announced the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Their spot as the entry-level iPhone was replaced by the first-generation iPhone SE, which was released earlier on March 31, 2016. The iPhone 6 was relaunched with 32 GB of storage in Asian markets in February 2017 as a midrange/budget iPhone. It was later expanded to Europe,[23][24] before hitting the US markets in May 2017,[25] and Canada in July 2017.[26] The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus supported iOS 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 before being dropped by iOS 13, and they are the third to support five versions of iOS after the iPhone 4s and the iPhone 5.


History
--------------------------------------------------
From the launch of the original iPhone to the iPhone 4s, iPhones used 3.5-inch displays—which are smaller than screens used by flagship phones from competitors. The iPhone 5 and its immediate successors featured a display that was taller, but the same width as prior models, measuring at 4 inches diagonally. Following Apple's loss in smartphone market share to companies producing phones with larger displays, reports as early as January 2014 suggested Apple was preparing to launch new iPhone models with larger, 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch displays.[27][28][29] Reports prior to its unveiling also speculated Apple might use a new iPhone model to introduce a mobile payments platform using near-field communications—a technology that was incorporated into many Android phones, but had experienced a low adoption rate among users.[30]

The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus were officially unveiled during a press event at the Flint Center for Performing Arts in Cupertino, California on September 9, 2014, and released on September 19, 2014; pre-orders began on September 12, 2014, with the iPhone 6 starting at US$199 and the iPhone 6 Plus starting at US$299.[31] In China, where the iPhone 5c and 5s were the first models in the iPhone series to be released in the country on the same day as their international launch, Apple notified local wireless carriers it would be unable to release the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus on the 19th there were "details which are not ready"; local media reported the devices had not yet been approved by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, and earlier in the year, a news report by state broadcaster China Central Television alleged iPhone devices were a threat to national security because iOS 7's "frequent locations" function could expose "state secrets."[32][33]

In August 2015, Apple initiated a replacement program for some early iPhone 6 Plus models that were found to have potentially faulty cameras that could be causing photos to appear blurry.[34][35][36]

On September 9, 2015, with the release of the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were moved to the mid-range of the iPhone lineup. The 128 GB versions of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus was discontinued along with the gold version of both phones, but the 16 GB and 64 GB versions of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in silver and space gray remained available for sale at a reduced price.[37]

In June 2016, Apple faced a potential sales ban in China, as Shenzhen Baili, a Chinese device maker, alleged the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus infringed on its design patent.[38]

The iPhone 6 was temporary discontinued on September 7, 2016, and the 6 Plus was permanently discontinued on same date, when Apple announced the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, and the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus' spot as the entry-level iPhone was taken by the first-generation iPhone SE. As the iPhone SE has more powerful internal hardware than the midrange iPhone 6 (largely the same as the 6S) and had been released earlier on March 31, 2016, this created an unusual situation when it was sold alongside the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus until September 7 despite being marketed as a lower-tier iPhone.

In February 2017, the iPhone 6 was quietly relaunched in carrier stores and online, this time the storage has been changed to 32 GB. In India, it was sold on Amazon's website in Space Grey. In Taiwan, it was sold through Taiwan Mobile on March 10 in gold color. In mid-March, it was released in the EU to Belarus via the i-Store webshop. It also makes an appearance in North America with Sprint based US prepaid carriers Boost Mobile and Virgin Mobile, along with AT&T GoPhone. These are not being distributed by Apple on their website or their retail stores.


Specifications
--------------------------------------------------

Hardware
--------------------------------------------------

Design
--------------------------------------------------
The design of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus is influenced by that of the iPad Air with a glass front that is curved around the edges of the display, and an aluminum rear that contains two plastic strips for the antenna.[39] The back is built of 6000-series aluminum.[40] Both models come in gold, silver, and "space gray" finishes. The iPhone 6 has a thickness of 6.9 millimetres (0.27 in), while the iPhone 6 Plus is 7.1 mm (0.28 in) in thickness; both are thinner than the iPhone 5c and iPhone 5s, with the iPhone 6 being Apple's thinnest phone to date.


Displays
--------------------------------------------------
The most significant changes to the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are its displays; both branded as "Retina HD Display" and "ion-strengthened", the iPhone 6 display is 4.7 inches in size with a 16:9 resolution of 1334x750 (326 ppi, minus one row of pixels), while the iPhone 6 Plus includes a 5.5-inch 1920x1080 (1080p) display (401 PPI). The displays use a multiple-domain LCD panel, dubbed "dual-domain pixels"; the RGB pixels themselves are skewed in a pattern so every pixel is seen from a different angle. This technique helps improve the viewing angles of the display.[41]

To accommodate the larger physical size of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, the top button was renamed to "side button" and moved to the side of the phone instead of the top to improve its accessibility.[21][22]


Batteries
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 6 features a 6.91 Wh (1,810 mAh) battery, while the iPhone 6 Plus features an 11.1 Wh (2,915 mAh) battery, neither of which are user-replaceable.[citation needed]


Chipsets
--------------------------------------------------
Both models include an Apple A8 system-on-chip, and an M8 motion co-processor—an update of the M7 chip from the iPhone 5s. The primary difference between the M8 and the original M7 coprocessor is the M8 also includes a barometer to measure altitude changes. Phil Schiller said the A8 chip would provide, in comparison to the 5s, a 25% increase in CPU performance, a 50% increase in graphics performance, and less heat output. Early hands-on reports said the A8's GPU performance might indeed break away from previous generations doubling of performance at each yearly release, scoring 21204.26 in Base mark X compared to 20253.80, 10973.36 and 5034.75 on respectively the 5s, 5 and 4s.[42]


Connectivity
--------------------------------------------------
The expanded LTE connectivity on the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus is improved to LTE Advanced, with support for over 20 LTE bands (seven more than the iPhone 5s),[43] for up to 150 Mbit/s download speed, and VoLTE support. Wi-Fi performance has been improved with support for 802.11ac specifications, providing speeds up to 433.0581 Mbit/s—which is up to three times faster than 802.11n,[43] along with Wi-Fi Calling support where available. The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus adds support for near-field communications (NFC). It is initially used exclusively for Apple Pay—a new mobile payments system which allows users to store their credit cards in Passbook for use with online payments and retail purchases over NFC.[44][45] iOS 11 added limited use of near-field communications besides Apple Pay for 3rd party apps.[46]


Camera
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 6's rear-facing camera now has the ability to shoot 1080p Full HD video at either 30 or 60 frames per second and 720p HD slow-motion video at either 120 or 240 frames per second, while the iPhone 5s could only record at 30 and 120 frames per second respectively.[citation needed] Unlike the previous models, the rear-facing camera is not flush with the rear of the device, but instead protrudes slightly.[47]

Still photos can be captured during video recording. Those have a resolution of four megapixels (2720×1532).[48][49]

The camera also includes phase detection autofocus.[50] The iPhone 6 Plus camera is nearly identical, but also includes optical image stabilization.[21][22] The front-facing camera was also updated with a new sensor and f/2.2 aperture, along with support for burst and HDR modes.[21][22]

However, the optical image stabilization of the iPhone 6 Plus is only available for photography and deactivated during video recording.[14]

The front camera has 1.3 Megapixels and records video up to 720p at 30 frames per second.[12]


Sensors
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus are the first iPhones to be equipped with a barometer sensor.[51]

Like the predecessor, the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus are equipped with an accelerometer, gyroscope, front-facing proximity sensor and a digital compass.[12]


Software
--------------------------------------------------
When first released, the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus were supplied pre-loaded with iOS 8. Apps are able to take advantage of the increased screen size in the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus to display more information on-screen; for example, the Mail app uses a dual-pane layout similar to its iPad version when the device is in landscape mode on the iPhone 6 Plus. As it uses an identical aspect ratio, apps designed for the iPhone 5, iPhone 5c, and 5s can be upscaled for use on the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. To improve the usability of the devices' larger screens, an additional "Reachability" gesture was added; double-tapping the Home button will slide the top half of the screen's contents down to the bottom half of the screen. This function allows users to reach buttons located near the top of the screen, such as a "Back" button in the top-left corner.[21][22] Tapping it once resets the screen timeout so the user does not have to look at the screen for an empty spot to tap on.[52]

In June 2019, Apple announced that it would drop support for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus with the release of iOS 13.[53][54][55]


Reception
--------------------------------------------------
Both iPhone 6 models received positive reviews. Re/code called it "the best smartphone you can buy".[56] TechRadar praised the iPhone 6's "brilliant" design, improved battery life over the 5s, iOS 8 for being "smarter and more intuitive than ever", along with the quality of its camera. However, the plastic antenna strips on the rear of the phone were criticized for resulting in poor aesthetics, the display for having lower resolution and pixel density in comparison to other recent smartphones – including those with the same physical screen size as the iPhone 6, such as the HTC One, and for not having a sufficient justification for its significantly higher price in comparison to similar devices running Android or Windows Phone.[57] The Verge considered the iPhone 6 to be "simply and cleanly designed" in comparison to the 5s, noting the phone still felt usable despite its larger size, but criticized the antenna plastic, the protruding camera lens (which prevents the device from sitting flat without a case), and the lack of additional optimization in the operating system for the bigger screen. Improvements such as performance, battery life, VoLTE support, and other tweaks were also noted. In conclusion, the iPhone 6 was considered "good, even great, but there's little about it that's truly ambitious or truly moving the needle. It's just a refinement of a lot of existing ideas into a much more pleasant package".[39]

In regards to the 6 Plus, Engadget panned its design for being uncomfortable to hold and harder to grip in comparison to other devices such as the Galaxy Note 3 and LG G3, but praised its inclusion of optical image stabilization and slightly better battery life than the 6.[50]

The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus have been criticized by Forbes Magazine for the lack of 2160p (3840×2160 pixels) video recording due to the insufficient image sensor resolution of 3264×2448 pixels. However, third-party software is able to record footage at 3264×1836 pixels upscaled to 3840×2160p.[58]


Issues
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were affected by a number of notable hardware-related issues, including but not limited to concerns surrounding their rigidity (which led to incidents surrounding chassis bending, as well as degradation or outright loss of touchscreen functionality), performance issues on models with larger storage capacity, camera problems on the 6 Plus model, as well as an initially undocumented "error 53" that appeared under certain circumstances.




Bendgate (chassis bending)
--------------------------------------------------
Shortly after its public release, it was reported the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus chassis was susceptible to bending under pressure, such as when carried tightly in a user's pocket. While such issues are not exclusive to the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, the design flaw came to be known among users and the media as "Bendgate".[59][60]

Apple responded to the bending allegations, stating they had only received nine complaints of bent devices and that the damage occurring due to regular use is "extremely rare." The company maintained the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus went through durability testing to ensure they would stand up to daily use.[61] The company offered to replace phones that were bent if it is determined the bending was unintentional.[59]

In May 2018, as part of a lawsuit against Apple regarding touchscreen failure, it was revealed via internal documents that Apple knew the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus phones were more likely to bend than previous models. According to the court documents, Apple's internal tests found the iPhone 6 was 3.3 times more likely to bend than the iPhone 5s, while the larger iPhone 6 Plus was 7.2 times more likely to bend.[62][63]


Hair ripping
--------------------------------------------------
On October 3, 2014 9to5Mac released a post claiming certain iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus users complained on social networking sites the phone ripped off their hair when they held the phone close to their ears when making phone calls.[64] Twitter users claimed the seam between the glass screen and aluminum back of the iPhone 6 was to blame, with hair becoming caught within it.[65][66]


Flash storage performance
--------------------------------------------------
Some users reported the 64 and 128 GB iPhone 6 models had experienced performance issues, and that some 128 GB iPhone 6 Plus models would, in rare cases, randomly crash and reboot. Business Korea reported the issues were connected to the triple-level cell NAND storage of the affected models. Triple-level NAND flash can store three bits of data per cell of flash, and are cheaper than dual-level cell solutions, but at the cost of performance. It was reported Apple had planned to switch the affected model lines back to multi-level cell flash, and address the performance issues on existing devices in a future iOS update.[67][68][69]


iPhone 6/6 Plus camera issues
--------------------------------------------------
It was reported the optical image stabilization systems on some iPhone 6 Plus models were faulty, failing to properly stabilize when the phone is being held perfectly still, leading to blurry photos and "wavy"-looking videos.[70] The optical image stabilization system was also found to have been affected by accessories that use magnets, such as third-party lens attachments; Apple issued advisories to users and its licensed accessory makers, warning magnetic or metallic accessories can cause the OIS to malfunction.[71]

On August 21, 2015, Apple instituted a repair program for iPhone 6 Plus models released between September 2014 and January 2015, citing faulty rear cameras on affected models may produce blurry pictures.[34][35][36]

Some iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus models have an issue in which the front-facing camera is somehow "shifted", or out of place. Apple stated they would replace most affected iPhone 6 models with this issue, free of charge. Despite numerous complaints regarding this issue, it does not seem to affect the camera itself. It is said the camera is not what has shifted, but a piece of protective foam around the camera module itself that has gone out of place.[72]


"Error 53"
--------------------------------------------------
If the iPhone 6 home button is repaired or modified by a third party, the device will fail security checks related to Touch ID as the components have not been "re-validated" for security reasons—a process that can only be performed by an authorized Apple outlet. Failing these checks disables all features related to Touch ID. Such effects have sometimes happened as a result of damage as well.[73][74]

It was reported these same hardware integrity checks would trigger an unrecoverable loop into "Recovery Mode" if iOS is updated or restored, with attempts to restore the device via iTunes software resulting in an "error 53" message. Beyond the explanation this is related to hardware integrity errors regarding Touch ID components, Apple provided no official explanation of what specifically triggers error 53 or how it can be fixed without replacing the entire device.[73][74]

On February 18, 2016, Apple released an iOS 9.2.1 patch through iTunes which addresses this issue and admitted error 53 was actually related to a diagnostic check for inspecting the Touch ID hardware before an iPhone is shipped from its factories.[75]


Touchscreen failure ("touch disease")
--------------------------------------------------
Touchscreen control components on iPhone 6 logic boards have insufficient support, including a lack of underfill—which strengthens and stabilizes integrated circuits, and a lack of rigid metal shielding on the logic board unlike previous iPhone models; the touchscreen controller is instead shielded by a flexible "sticker". Normal use of the device can cause the logic board to flex internally, which strains the touchscreen IC connectors and leads to a degradation or outright loss of touchscreen functionality. A symptom that has been associated with this type of failure is a flickering grey bar near the top of the display.[76][77] iFixit reported this issue, nicknamed "touch disease",[76][78][79] was a byproduct of the previous "Bendgate" design flaw because of the device's demonstrated lack of rigidity. As such, the larger iPhone 6 Plus is more susceptible to the flaw, but it has also been reported on a small percentage of iPhone 6 models.[79][80][81] The devices' successor, the iPhone 6s, is not afflicted by this flaw due to changes to their internal design, which included the strengthening of "key points" in the rear casing, and the re-location of the touchscreen controllers to the display assembly from the logic board.[80]

Initially, Apple did not officially acknowledge this issue. The issue was widely discussed on Apple's support forum—where posts discussing the issue have been subject to censorship.[77] The touchscreen can be repaired via microsoldering: Apple Stores are not equipped with the tools needed to perform the logic board repair, which had led to affected users sending their devices to unofficial, third-party repair services. An Apple Store employee interviewed by Apple Insider reported six months after they first started noticing the problem, Apple had issued guidance instructing them to tell affected users this was a hardware issue that could not be repaired and that their iPhone had to be replaced. However, some in-stock units have also been afflicted with this issue out of the box, leading to an employee stating they were "tired of pulling service stock out of the box, and seeing the exact same problem the customer has on the replacement".[81][82] The issue received mainstream attention in August 2016 when reported by iFixit.[76][79][81] On August 26, 2016, Apple Insider reported based on data from four "high-traffic" Apple Store locations, there was a spike in the number of iPhone 6 devices brought into them for repairs following mainstream reports of the "touch disease" problem.[82]

On August 30, 2016, a group of three iPhone 6 owners sued Apple Inc. in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California and filed for a proposed class action lawsuit, alleging Apple was engaging in unfair business practices by having "long been aware" of the defective design, yet refusing to acknowledge or repair it.[78][83][84]

On November 17, 2016, Apple officially acknowledged the issue and announced a paid repair program for affected iPhone 6 Plus models, stating; "some iPhone 6 Plus devices may exhibit display flickering or Multi-Touch issues after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device".[85]


Sales
--------------------------------------------------
Apple Inc. announced, within 24 hours of availability, over 4 million pre-orders of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were made, exceeding the supply available—an Apple record.[86] 10 million iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus devices were sold in the first three days, marking another Apple record. The iPhone 6S & 6S Plus were introduced in September 2015 selling 13 million units which set the record for sales in the first three days from last years release.[87] Three months after its release, the iPhone 6 generated 71.5 million unit sales.[88]

As of June 2017, the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus have sold 222.4 million units worldwide, making them the most popular iPhone models and the best-selling smartphones of all time.[89][88]

List of iPhone models

The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus[a] are smartphones that were developed and marketed by Apple Inc. They are the tenth generation of the iPhone. They were announced on September 7, 2016, at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco by Apple CEO Tim Cook, and were released on September 16, 2016, succeeding the iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus as the flagship devices in the iPhone series. Apple also released the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in numerous countries worldwide throughout September and October 2016. They were succeeded as flagship devices by the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus[12] on September 12, 2017, and were discontinued with the announcement of the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro on September 10, 2019.

The iPhone 7's overall design is similar to the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S. Changes introduced included new color options (Matte Black and Jet Black), water and dust resistance, a new capacitive, static home button, revised antenna bands, and the controversial removal of the 3.5 mm headphone jack. The device's internal hardware received upgrades, including a heterogeneous quad-core system-on-chip with improved system and graphics performance, upgraded 12 megapixel rear-facing cameras with optical image stabilization on all models, and an additional telephoto lens exclusive to the iPhone 7 Plus to provide enhanced (2x) optical zoom capabilities and portrait mode. The front camera is the first in the series with 1080p (Full HD) video resolution. The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus were supported from iOS 10 to iOS 15, and they are the third to support six versions of iOS before support was terminated, after the iPhone 5s.

The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus were the last iPhones using a quad-core CPU, as well as an aluminum unibody design without wireless charging and a base model starting at 32 GB of internal storage.

The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus were the only iPhones to have a jet black color finish.


History
--------------------------------------------------
Prior to its announcement, multiple aspects of the iPhone 7 were heavily rumoured. Apple's plans to remove the 3.5 mm headphone jack received significant media attention.[b] Other rumors included a flush camera, stereo speakers,[17] a 256 gigabyte storage option, and a larger 3,100 mAh battery.[18]

On August 29, 2016, invitations to a press event at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco, California on September 7, 2016, were sent out to members of the media, prompting immediate speculation of the iPhone 7's upcoming announcement.[19][20] The iPhone 7 was officially announced at that event, with pre-orders beginning September 9, and general availability on September 16.[21][22][23]

The iPhone 7 launched in 30 new countries later in September, with further international rollouts throughout October and November 2016.[c] Indonesia was the last country to release the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, with availability starting on March 31, 2017, following Apple's research and development investment in the country.[31]

On March 21, 2017, Apple announced an iPhone 7 with a red color finish (and white front), as part of its partnership with Product Red to highlight its AIDS fundraising campaign. It launched on March 24, 2017,[32][33] but it was later discontinued after the announcement of the iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X in September 2017 as well as the 256 GB Variant.[34]

On September 12, 2017, Apple announced the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus as direct successors to the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus,[35] alongside the iPhone X.[36]

The iPhone 7 & 7 Plus, as well as the iPhone XS and its Max variant were discontinued and removed from Apple's website after the announcement of the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro on September 10, 2019. They are no longer available for sale.

On June 6, 2022, Apple announced on its website that the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus will not receive support for iOS 16. Controversially, the iPad (5th generation), which has the A9 chip, received iPadOS 16, along with the 6th and 7th generation iPads, which have almost identical hardware to the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus respectively.[37]


Specifications
--------------------------------------------------

Design
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 7's exterior is similar in shape and volume to the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S, although the camera bump is bigger on the iPhone 7. Alongside the existing silver, gold, and rose gold colors, the device is offered in new colors of matte black, glossy "jet black",[21] and, for a limited time, red.[32][33] The "jet black" color is a dark shade, high-gloss black finish. It is created through a multi-step process, beginning with an anodization phase to make the surface of the casing a porous aluminum oxide, and then using a machine to sweep the casing through a powdered compound, absorbed by aluminum oxide. The process is concluded with an "ultrafine particle bath" for additional finishing; the entire process takes less than an hour.[38]


Water protection
--------------------------------------------------
iPhone 7 is rated IP67 water and dust resistant, making it the first officially water-resistant iPhone,[39] although tests have resulted in malfunctions, specifically distorted speakers, after water exposure.[40] The warranty does not cover any water damage to the phone.[41]


Home button
--------------------------------------------------
iPhone 7's home button uses a capacitive mechanism for input rather than a physical push-button, as on previous models, meaning direct skin contact (or a capacitive glove) is required to operate the device.[42][43] Physical feedback is provided via a Taptic Engine vibrator, and the button is also pressure-sensitive.[44] iPhone 7 retains the 3D Touch display system introduced on the iPhone 6S, providing pressure-sensitive touchscreen input.[21]


Headphone plug removal
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are the first iPhones not to feature a 3.5mm headphone jack. It was replaced by a second speaker grille that serves as a vent for the internal barometer.[45] A Lightning-to-3.5-mm-connector adapter, as well as in-ear headphones that use the Lightning connector, were bundled with the device,[21] and the adapter is also sold separately as an accessory.[46] The adapter is also compatible with other iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch devices running iOS 10 and newer.[47]


Hardware
--------------------------------------------------

Chipsets
--------------------------------------------------
iPhone 7 uses the Apple A10 Fusion 64-bit system-on-chip, which consists of two low-power cores and two high-power cores (only two cores are used at any point in time[48]). The A10 chip also features a hexa-core graphics chip capable of "console-level gaming".[49] As with prior models, iPhone 7 is available in two sizes: one with a 4.7 in (120 mm) screen, and a "Plus" variant with a 5.5 in (140 mm) screen.[50] The displays have identical sizes and resolutions to iPhone 6S, but with a wider color gamut[21] and increased brightness.[51] The screen-to-body ratio is about ~66% and ~68% for the 7 and 7 Plus, respectively.[52][53]

Both device variants also contain a new iteration of Apple's motion coprocessor, the M10.[54] Unlike previous iPhone models, internal storage options for iPhone 7 begin at 32 GB instead of 16 GB, and max out at 256 GB.[55] iPhone 7 Plus offers 3 GB of RAM, more than any other previous iPhone;[48] the 4.7-inch iPhone 7 has 2 GB.[56]


Cameras
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 7 includes a 12-megapixel rear-facing camera with a quad-LED "True Tone" flash; its aperture was widened to f/1.8, and the standard-size phone model adds optical image stabilization – a feature that was previously exclusive to Plus models.[57]

The iPhone 7 Plus includes a second 12-megapixel telephoto lens, which can be used to achieve 2× optical zoom, and up to 10× digital zoom. However, the telephoto camera has an f/2.8 aperture and lacks optical image stabilization.[58]

The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus record video with single-channel mono audio.[59]

Still photos with 6.5 megapixels (3412×1920) can be captured during video recording.[60]

The front-facing camera was upgraded to a 7-megapixel sensor with automatic image stabilization.[21][61]

The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are the first iPhones to be able to record 1080p video using the front camera.[62]


Battery life
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 7 has a 1,960 mAh battery which can last about 3–5 hours. The iPhone 7 Plus has 2,900 mAh battery and can last for 5–8 hours.


Software
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 7 originally shipped with iOS 10 pre-installed.[63] The iPhone 7 Plus received an exclusive portrait camera mode in the iOS 10.1 software update.[64] This camera mode is capable of producing a bokeh effect using depth of field analysis of the second camera of dual-lens in the back of iPhone 7 Plus. Mainstream software support for the iPhone 7 was dropped when iOS 16 was released.[65][66] But, it still receives iOS 15 security updates (as of January 22, 2024). The current version of iOS to support iPhone 7 is iOS 15.8.3.[67] The device can also run Android 10 unofficially via a project called Project Sandcastle made by Corellium, a security research company that produces paid iOS, Android, and IoT emulators.[68] Ubuntu 20.04 "Focal Fossa" has also been ported via Project Sandcastle.[69]


Accessories
--------------------------------------------------
Each iPhone 7 originally came with a Lightning-to-3.5-mm adapter,[21] although this was omitted starting on September 12, 2018.[70] Apple sells the adapter independently as well.[46] iPhone 7 does not have a built-in DAC, a Cirrus Logic CS4272 DAC is included as part of the adapter. Apple also unveiled several Bluetooth wireless headphones ostensibly intended for use with the iPhone 7, including AirPods, wireless in-ear headphones, and three new Beats headphone products. All four products utilize an in-house wireless chip known as the Apple W1, which is designed to provide low-power Bluetooth operation and integration with iOS and macOS devices (though they are still compatible with other Bluetooth-supported devices).[71][72]


Reception
--------------------------------------------------
Reception of the iPhone 7 was mixed. Although reviewers noted improvements to the camera, especially the dual rear camera on the Plus model, the phone was criticized for the lack of innovation in its build quality. Many reviews panned the removal of the 3.5 mm headphone jack; some critics argued that the change was meant to bolster licensing of the proprietary Lightning connector and the sales of Apple's own wireless headphone products, and questioned the effects of the change on audio quality. Apple was also mocked by critics for Phil Schiller's statement that such a drastic change required "courage".

Gordon Kelly of Forbes noted that rival smartphones, such as the Samsung Galaxy S7, had increased battery life and added water resistance over its predecessor while retaining the headphone jack, and that the iPhone 7's camera photo quality was improved but still lagging behind some phones already on the market, including the Galaxy S7 and Nexus 6P. Kelly praised how Apple was able to extract improved brightness and accurate color reproduction from its LCD display panel, while noting that it was old technology which was also well behind rivals who had already moved to sharper 1080p or even 2K screens. The iPhone 7's exterior, which reuses the aging design of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S, was criticized, especially the size of the device and thick top/bottom bezels, with Kelly writing that "the iPhone 7 Plus is simply far too big for a smartphone with a 5.5-inch display".[73]

Nilay Patel of The Verge described the device as being "full of aggressive breaks from convention," noting the headphone jack removal, heterogeneous CPU, and home button redesign, going as far as dubbing it "a prototype of next year's rumored drastic iPhone redesign disguised as an iPhone 6." The display quality was considered an improvement over previous models, albeit "not as insane" as the quad HD displays on competing phones. The Taptic Engine was considered the "first really valuable new UI concept I've seen on phones in years" (as opposed to the "gimmick" of 3D Touch), Patel felt that the cameras of the devices were a step above the 6S in terms of performance, and praised the dual-lens camera on the 7 Plus for enhancing the phone's camera functionality. However, he panned the lack of editing features that made use of them. In regards to the enhanced Bluetooth audio support provided by devices containing the W1 chip, he argued that Apple "took away an established open standard in favor of new technologies, but instead of making the experience of using those new technologies better across the board, it made every third-party wireless audio product a second-class citizen of the Apple ecosystem." Giving the iPhone 7 a 9 out of 10, he concluded that the devices were "legitimately among the most interesting, opinionated, powerful phones Apple has ever shipped, and the most confident expressions of the company's vision in a long time. iOS 10 is excellent, the cameras are better, and the performance is phenomenal. And the batteries last longer."[74]

John McCann of TechRadar wrote that for the first time, the phablet-sized iPhone 7 Plus was "markedly better" than the smaller model. He highlighted improved battery life and praised the camera, calling the Plus' dual cameras "excellent" for point-and-shoot, and "much improved" for low-light performance. McCann wrote that the lack of a headphone jack was "initially frustrating", but noted that it was a "positive step forward for the mobile industry", despite the "short-term effects ... making the most noise for now".[75]


Headphone jack controversy
--------------------------------------------------
Criticism of the iPhone 7 centered around the removal of the headphone jack, including the inability to use wired headphones with the included adapter and charge the device simultaneously.[d][77]

In a particularly scathing article, Nilay Patel of The Verge wrote that removing the headphone jack, "a deeply established standard" as he put it, would be "user-hostile and stupid". He goes on to list reasons why removing the port is negative, concluding with "No one is asking for this" and "Vote with your dollars".[78]

Gordon Kelly of Forbes noted that wireless audio technology was immature at the moment, with Bluetooth audio quality being inferior and Lightning's audio reliability still in question. The removal of the headphone jack meant that in Patel's words, "You're being pushed into an era where you will have to pay more for decent headphones due to their need for an integrated DAC and/or Lightning licensing", and pointed out that "the only company to profit from this situation is Apple, who will now be charging licensing fees to millions of headphone companies".[73]

In particular, Apple's vice president Phil Schiller, who announced the change, was mocked extensively online for stating that removing the headphone jack took 'courage'.[79][80] An online petition created by the consumer group SumOfUs, that accuses Apple of planned obsolescence and causing substantial electronic waste by removing the headphone jack,[81] reached over 300,000 signatures.[82]


Issues
--------------------------------------------------

Hissing noises
--------------------------------------------------
Some users have reported a strange hissing noise during heavy usage of the phone. CNET reports it as "faint buzzes and hums coming from the backside".[83] The Daily Telegraph speculates that the iPhone 7's new A10 Fusion processor is the source of the noise, linking to tweets that compare the phone's hissing sound to "hearing the fans spin up loudly whenever your Mac's CPU gets used to its actual potential."[84]


Performance differences
--------------------------------------------------
The Guardian reported in October 2016 that storage tests from Unbox Therapy and GSMArena showed that the 32 GB iPhone 7 is "significantly" slower than the 128 and 256 GB versions, measuring data write speeds of 341 MB/s on a 128 GB iPhone 7 model versus 42 MB/s on a 32 GB model.[85] October 2016 network tests by Cellular Insights showed that models A1660 and A1661 with Qualcomm modems had "a significant performance edge" over models A1778 and A1784 with Intel modems. Inspection of the modems also found that the Qualcomm version's ability to use Ultra HD Voice had been turned off, likely to "level the playing field between the Qualcomm, and Intel variants". The report concluded with the statement that "We are not sure what was the main reason behind Apple's decision to source two different modem suppliers for the newest iPhone".[86][87] Bloomberg reported in November 2016 that tests by researchers from Twin Prime and Cellular Insights had shown the two modems to perform similarly on some U.S. cellular networks despite one of the modems being technically capable of faster connectivity. Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller told the publication that "Every iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus meets or exceeds all of Apple's wireless performance standards, quality metrics, and reliability testing ... In all of our rigorous lab tests based on wireless industry standards, in thousands of hours of real-world field testing, and in extensive carrier partner testing, the data shows there is no discernible difference in the wireless performance of any of the models". Bloomberg quoted analysts and technology advisers who stated that "[Apple] don't want one version to get the reputation that it is better" and that "This may not impact the fanboys, but it may make other consumers think twice about buying an Apple phone, especially if they think they might be purchasing a sub-standard product".[88]


Perception of slogan in Cantonese-speaking regions
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 7's "This is 7" slogan has been misunderstood when translated to certain other languages.[89][90] The phone's slogan in Mainland China is "7, is here;" (Chinese: 7，在此; pinyin: 7, zài cǐ), while in Hong Kong, its slogan is, "This, is iPhone 7;" (Chinese: 這，就是iPhone 7; Jyutping: ze5, zau6 si6 iPhone 7).

In Cantonese, the local language of Hong Kong, the slogan could be mistakenly interpreted as "This is penis". "Tsat", (Chinese: 杘; Jyutping: cat6), is a common slang term for an erect penis, and "seven", (Chinese: 七; Jyutping: cat1), which varies only in tone, is often used as a euphemism.[citation needed]


Replacing the home button
--------------------------------------------------
In the iPhone 7, Apple added a software lock that prevents individuals from attempting to replace the home button on their own. Users are now required to go to an Apple Store to have repairs done, with "recalibration" of the button being necessary. This is a step further than Apple went with iPhone 5S, 6 and 6S, where only Touch ID functionality would get disabled but the "return-to-home" functionality still worked.[91][92]


Failure to connect to cellular service
--------------------------------------------------
Some iPhone 7 devices with the model numbers A1660, A1779 and A1780 suffer from a problem where they show a "No service" message even when cellular reception is available. Apple will repair those devices for free within four years of the first retail sale of the unit.[93]


Loop disease
--------------------------------------------------
Some iPhone 7 devices suffer from a problem that affects audio in the device. Users reported a grayed-out speaker button during calls, grayed-out voice memo icon, and occasional freezing of the device. A few users also complained that lightning EarPods failed to work with the device and that the Wi-Fi button would be grayed out after restarting the iPhone. On May 4, 2018, Apple acknowledged the issue through an internal memo. If an affected iPhone 7 was no longer covered by warranty, Apple said its service providers could request an exception for this particular issue. The exemptions abruptly ended in July 2018 when Apple deleted the internal document. Many customers have complained Apple has charged customers around $350 to fix the issue. Many customers complain the issue first appeared after a software update.


Sales
--------------------------------------------------
Apple has deliberately withheld pre-order sales numbers, citing that these are "no longer a representative metric for our investors and customers".[94] Without releasing specific numbers, T-Mobile US stated that the iPhone 7 had broken the carrier's all-time record for first-day pre-order sales. The following weekend, T-Mobile US stated that iPhone 7 was its biggest iPhone launch ever, being "up nearly 4x compared to the next most popular iPhone".[95]

On September 14, 2016, two days before the iPhone 7 went on sale, Apple announced that due to high demand, they had sold out of all "jet black" iPhone 7's, and all colors of the iPhone 7 Plus.[96] This caused issues for customers in the iPhone Upgrade Program, who were unable to reserve new phones.[97] After customer complaints and a class action lawsuit,[98] Apple made changes to ensure members of the program could get new phones as soon as possible.[99]

In May 2017, analytics research company Strategy Analytics announced that iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus were the best-selling smartphones worldwide during the first quarter of 2017, selling 21.5 million and 17.4 million units, respectively.[100][101]


US carrier trade-in deals
--------------------------------------------------
For the initial U.S. sales of the iPhone 7, all four major wireless carriers announced trade-in deals. Under the deals, the monthly installment plan cost of the iPhone 7 is negated by a monthly credit on consumers' bill, but consumers who cancel their service with the carrier or pay off the phone prior to the installment contract completion will not receive credits for the remaining months.[102] Jacob Kastrenakes of The Verge noted that the deals effectively constituted a return to two-year phone contracts, in which the deals "essentially lock you into that carrier for two years".[103]

In the wake of these deals, Verizon announced they had seen an increase in sales over the release of the previous year's iPhone 6S, AT&T said that sales had exceeded its expectations, and T-Mobile and Sprint announced "huge increases in sales", with T-Mobile seeing a demand roughly four times higher for the 7 than the 6.[104]


Reports about trimmed production
--------------------------------------------------
In December 2016, DigiTimes reported that Apple had reduced production of the iPhone 7 because of decreasing demand for the product after the initial surge of interest waned. A reason cited was consumers and suppliers turning their attention to next year's iPhone model.[105][106]

A new report from Nikkei at the end of December included details on sales and production of the iPhone 7. The report, "based on data from suppliers", stated that Apple would trim production of the iPhone 7 by 10% in the first quarter of 2017, following "sluggish" sales. Nikkei reported that Apple previously trimmed production of the iPhone 7 by 20% due to accumulated inventory of the previous model, but that the new models had "sold more sluggishly than expected". Additionally, the report notes that the "iPhone 7 Plus, which features two cameras on its back face, remains popular", but "a shortage of camera sensors has curbed Apple's ability to meet demand for the phones".[107]

List of iPhone models

The iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Mini (stylized and marketed as iPhone 12 mini) are smartphones developed and marketed by Apple Inc. They are the fourteenth-generation iPhones, succeeding the iPhone 11.[19] They were unveiled at a virtually held Apple Special Event at Apple Park in Cupertino, California, on October 13, 2020, alongside the "premium flagship" iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max and HomePod Mini. Pre-orders for the iPhone 12 started on October 16, 2020, and the phone was released in most countries on October 23, 2020, alongside the iPhone 12 Pro and fourth-generation iPad Air. Pre-orders for the iPhone 12 Mini began on November 6, 2020, and the phone was released on November 13, 2020, alongside the iPhone 12 Pro Max.[20]

The major upgrades over the iPhone 11[21] include the addition of a Super Retina XDR OLED as opposed to the Liquid Retina LED-backlit LCD IPS panel on the iPhone 11 and XR, 5G support, the introduction of MagSafe, Apple A14 Bionic system on a chip (SoC) and high-dynamic-range video Dolby Vision 4K up to 30 fps.[22] The iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Mini, like the iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max, are the first iPhone models from Apple to no longer include a power adapter or EarPods headphones found in prior iPhone models; however, a USB-C to Lightning cable is included; this change was retroactively applied to other iPhone models sold by Apple, such as the iPhone XR, iPhone 11 and the second-generation iPhone SE.


Design
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 12 and 12 Mini is the first major redesign since the iPhone X. It features a chassis with flat edges, similar to the iPhone 4 and iPhone 5 designs, as well as the iPad Pro since 2018, and the 4th-generation iPad Air, which was also released in 2020. The notch size is similar to previous iPhone models, despite speculation about a reduction in width.[23] The borders around the display are thinner by 35% than any previous model. The new design also comes with a ceramic-hardened front glass, marketed as Ceramic Shield, while the back retains the previous generation Dual-Ion Exchange strengthened glass.[24]

On April 20, 2021, at Apple's Special Event “Spring Loaded”, Apple revealed a new purple color option which became available on April 30, 2021.[25]

The iPhone 12 and 12 Mini are available in six colors: Black, White, Product Red, Green, Blue, and Purple.[24]


Specifications
--------------------------------------------------

Hardware
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Mini use Apple's six-core A14 Bionic processor, which contains a next-generation neural engine. They both have three internal storage options: 64, 128, and 256 GB.[a] Both also carry an IP68 water and dust resistance rating along with dirt and grime, and is water-resistant up to six meters (20 feet) for 30 minutes. However, the manufacturer warranty does not cover liquid damage to the phone.

The iPhone 12 series are the first iPhone models to be supplied from launch without EarPods or a wall adapter, which Apple says was done to reduce carbon emissions and waste since most users already own them. Apple also claims 70% more boxes can fit on a pallet given the smaller box, and thus further reducing emissions.[26] A USB-C to Lightning cord is still included. This change also applies retroactively to all other iPhone models still in production.[27] To comply with French law regarding wireless device radiation and health which requires phones to be bundled with and promote use of hands-free accessories by children under 14, iPhone models will still include EarPods in this market.[28]

A magnetic connector known as MagSafe is introduced on the iPhone 12 models, allowing accessories such as cases and charging cords to be attached to the rear of the device. Accessories can also be stacked together.[29]

The devices support 5G cellular communications. This allows upload speeds of up to 200 Mbit/s and download speeds of up to 4 Gbit/s.[30] However, only models sold in the U.S. support the fastest mmWave technology; those sold elsewhere in the world, including Canada, support only sub-6 GHz frequency bands.[31] A new feature called Smart Data Mode enables 5G only when necessary to preserve battery life.[32]


Displays
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 12 features a 6.1-inch (155 mm) display[33] with Super Retina XDR OLED technology at a resolution of 2532 × 1170 pixels and a pixel density of about 460 ppi.[34] The iPhone 12 Mini features a 5.4-inch (137 mm) display with the same technology at a resolution of 2340 × 1080 pixels, and a pixel density of about 476 ppi. Both phones have a peak brightness of 1200 nits when viewing HDR content equivalent to the iPhone 12 Pro, and normal brightness of 625 nits.[34] Both phones also use an improved glass-ceramic covering called Ceramic Shield which is co-developed with Corning Inc. Apple describes it as having "4 times better drop performance" and being "tougher than any smartphone glass".[35]


Batteries
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 12 has a 10.78 Wh (2,815 mAh) battery, a slight decrease from the 11.91 Wh (3,110 mAh) battery found in the iPhone 11 and identical to the battery found in the iPhone 12 Pro. The iPhone 12 Mini has a 8.57 Wh (2,227 mAh) battery. Like previous iPhones, the battery is not user-replaceable.[36]


Chipsets
--------------------------------------------------
Both the iPhone 12 and 12 Mini have the Apple A14 Bionic, the first ARM-based smartphone system-on-a-chip (SoC) manufactured on the 5 nm process node. However, unlike previous years, they are not the first Apple devices to receive the newest A-series processor, with the fourth-generation iPad Air being the first. Both phones use Qualcomm's Snapdragon X55 5G modem.


Cameras
--------------------------------------------------
Both phones have two rear 12-megapixel cameras: wide and ultra-wide. The wide camera is a 26 mm full-frame equivalent with an f/1.6 aperture which captures 27% more light than the f/1.8 aperture in the iPhone 11[20] and a seven-element lens. The ultra-wide camera is a 13 mm full-frame equivalent with an f/2.4 aperture and a five-element lens.[37]

All cameras now support Night Mode for both photo and time-lapse video at full resolution.[24] Smart HDR has been improved thanks to Smart HDR 3.[37] This iPhone model is the first capable of shooting 10-bit high dynamic range Dolby Vision 4K video at up to 30 fps which allows for greater brightness and deeper shadows.[38]

The front-facing, TrueDepth camera features a 12-megapixel camera with an f/2.2 aperture. This model also added Night Mode to the front-facing camera.[24]

Sensors

The iPhone 12 and 12 Mini include mostly the same sensors found on prior iPhone models going back to the iPhone X. These include an accelerometer, gyroscope, barometer, proximity sensor, ambient light sensor, and a digital compass. The devices also include the Face ID sensor for biometric authentication.


Software
--------------------------------------------------
Both phones originally shipped with iOS 14.[24] The devices come with the stock iOS apps, such as Safari, Weather, and Messages, and they include Siri, the personal assistant in iOS. They received iOS 15 on September 20, 2021, iOS 16 on September 12, 2022, iOS 17 on September 18, 2023, and most recently, iOS 18 on September 16, 2024.[39]


Reception
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 12 received largely positive reviews. The Verge called it a "beautiful, powerful, and incredibly capable device", praising the new design reminiscent of the iPhone 5, the speed of the A14 Bionic processor, its 5G capabilities, addition of the OLED display like on the high end iPhones, combined with much slimmer bezels than previous iPhone models and improved battery life over iPhone 11.[40] Engadget also gave the iPhone 12 a positive review, praising the MagSafe wireless charging and accessories magnetic attachment as well as the redesigned camera system, a greatly improved display like in its Pro counterparts.[41]

iPhone 12 was the third best-selling and was the most popular model globally in Q2 2021.[42]

Apple was criticized for the continued reliance on Face ID as the sole biometric option to unlock the device, which is incompatible with face masks. iOS 14.5 allowed the use of a paired Apple Watch to unlock the phone while wearing a mask, while iOS 15.4 allows unlocking with a mask on, without an Apple Watch. The third-generation iPhone SE is the only iPhone currently produced by Apple that supports Touch ID, an alternative unlocking option that is compatible with face masks. All models can still use a passcode to log in.[43][44][45][46]

The iPhone 12 mini has received more mixed reviews. Some praised the phone for being a new small phone, while others criticized the price and inferior battery life compared to the full-size 12[47] (although the battery life of the iPhone 12 mini is longer than that of the second-generation iPhone SE[48]).


"OLED-gate"
--------------------------------------------------
Within two weeks after its public release, a thread was started at Apple Support Communities describing a problem with the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro OLED panel black pixels not shutting off completely in black scenes, resulting in what was described as "ugly glowing".[49] A considerable number of users have since posted replies reporting the same problem, photos and videos have been shared online demonstrating the issue. As of January 2021, Apple has not yet made an official statement.


EarPods and power adapter controversy
--------------------------------------------------
Apple no longer includes either EarPods or a power adapter in the boxes of all iPhone 12 and 12 Pro models, claiming that it is an environmental initiative and no longer including them would reduce e-waste and permit smaller iPhone boxes, allowing more devices to be transported simultaneously to decrease its carbon footprint. The boxes only include a USB-C to Lightning cable, incompatible with the existing USB-A power adapters that Apple previously supplied with its devices. Users can still use their existing USB-A power adapters and cables but must purchase a USB-C power adapter sold separately to enable fast charging.

The iPhone 12 was sold in France with EarPods as the law required that smartphones be bundled with “hands-free kits” or a “headset” in order to protect children aged 14 and younger from electromagnetic radiation.[50][51]

In December 2020, a Brazilian consumer rights watchdog Procon-SP Foundation requested Apple to provide proof that not including chargers is beneficial to the environment. The watchdog argues that Apple removing the charger is harming consumers and wants to force the company to include one as it claims the charger is an essential component.[52]

The Verge reported the reason power adapters and EarPods are no longer included could be to offset the increased cost of 5G components. These new components are reported to cost 30% more than their predecessors.[53]


Repairability concerns
--------------------------------------------------
iFixit and Australian YouTuber Hugh Jeffreys discovered that a number of key components such as the cameras would malfunction or display warnings if they are replaced with new ones or those taken from an otherwise identical donor unit.[54] Internal Apple documents also mention that, beginning with the iPhone 12 and in subsequent models, authorized technicians would have to run the phones through an internal System Configuration tool to reprogram repaired units in order to account for hardware changes. While Apple has yet to comment on the issue, the inability to replace key system components have raised concerns about right to repair and planned obsolescence.[55] However, the iPhone 12 Mini does not have this issue.[56] Apple later addressed the issue with the release of iOS 14.4, which displays a warning message if the phone detects an unpaired camera module but otherwise allows for full functionality.[57]


Electromagnetic radiation concerns
--------------------------------------------------
In September 2023, the French watchdog agency Agence nationale des fréquences [fr] notified Apple that sales of the iPhone 12 must be halted in France due to the device exceeding the legal specific absorption rate for consumer electronics. The agency also requested that Apple must recall all iPhone 12s that have been produced in order to meet safety regulations. However, this coincided with the release of the iPhone 15 models where Apple also discontinued the iPhone 12 globally.[58]

Despite the move however, France's digital minister did emphasize the iPhone 12's radiation levels[59] remained well below the threshold deemed harmful by scientific studies. Even Apple, "...disputed the findings and said the device complies with regulations..." [Regulations | source 39]. This highlighted a discrepancy between the agency's tests and real-world phone usage scenarios.[60]

List of iPhone models

The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus are smartphones developed and marketed by Apple Inc. They are the sixteenth-generation iPhones, succeeding the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini, and were announced during Apple Event, Apple Park in Cupertino, California, on September 7, 2022, alongside the higher-priced iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max flagships. The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus feature a 6.1-inch (15 cm) and 6.7-inch (17 cm) display, improvements to the rear-facing camera, and satellite connectivity for contacting emergency services when a user in trouble is beyond the range of Wi-Fi or cellular networks.[11][12] The iPhone 14 was made available on September 16, 2022,[13] and iPhone 14 Plus was made available on October 7, 2022, priced at $799 and $899 respectively and was launched with iOS 16.[8][14] Pre-orders for the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus began on September 9, 2022.[15] Along with the 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max, the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus are the last iPhones to feature the Lightning port, as their successors, the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus (announced on September 12, 2023), use a USB-C port instead, per European Commission regulation.[16][17]

The iPhone 14 does not have a "Mini" version like its predecessor, the iPhone 13. Instead, Apple returned to a larger model with the iPhone 14 Plus. Apple had not introduced a "Plus" model iPhone since the iPhone 8 Plus in 2017. Both iPhone 14 models (as well as iPhone 14 Pro models) sold in the United States, ended support for physical SIM cards, making them the first iPhone models since the CDMA variant of the iPhone 4 to not come with a discrete SIM card reader, requiring activation by way of eSIM.[18] With Apple retiring the iPhone 13 in September 2024, the iPhone 14 is currently the oldest iPhone model still fully supported and sold by Apple.


History
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 14 was originally rumored to come with 6.1-inch and 5.4-inch display size options. However, when the iPhone 14 was unveiled, no smaller display option was available. This may have been due to underwhelming sales of the iPhone 12 Mini and iPhone 13 Mini. Instead, a larger 6.7-inch display size option was added to the lower-priced iPhone 14 lineup.[19][20] The new 6.7-inch variant of the iPhone 14 was named "iPhone 14 Plus", rather than "iPhone 14 Max", which was predicted by previous rumors.[21][22]

The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus were officially announced at Apple's "Far Out" event, along with the iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 14 Pro Max, Apple Watch Series 8, Apple Watch SE (2nd generation), Apple Watch Ultra, AirPods Pro (2nd generation) and an update to Apple Fitness+ via a virtual press conference filmed at Apple Park in Cupertino, California on September 7, 2022.[23][24]

Apple started taking pre-orders on September 9, with general availability from September 16 for the iPhone 14 and October 7 for the iPhone 14 Plus.[25]


Design
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus have an identical design to the iPhone 13, although the US models do not have a physical SIM tray.

The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus are available in six colors: Blue, Purple, Midnight, Starlight, Yellow, and Product Red.[27] Purple is a new color replacing Pink used on the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini. The yellow colour option was added on March 7, 2023.[28]


Hardware
--------------------------------------------------
iPhone 14 and 14 Plus are available in three internal storage configurations: 128, 256, and 512 GB. Both models have 6 GB of RAM, an increase over the previous iPhone 13 and 13 mini models' 4 GB of RAM. The iPhone 14 and 14 Plus have the same IP68 rating for dust and water resistance as their predecessors.[7]


Chipset
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 14 and 14 Plus use a 5-nanometer Apple-designed SOC, the A15 Bionic, while the iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max have a newer A16 Bionic.[29][30]

The iPhone 14's A15 chip has a 6-core CPU, 5-core GPU, and a 16-core Neural Engine. It is identical to the A15 in the previous year's iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max,[29][30] which has more memory and an additional GPU core compared to the A15 in the non-Pro iPhone 13 models.[31][32]

The iPhone 14 was the first flagship model since the 2008 iPhone 3G, whose chip was unchanged from the previous year.[29] The Verge's Mitchell Clark attributed the unchanged chip to an attempt to maintain costs during the ongoing chip shortage and inflation surge. Clark also said the A15 "still outperforms the latest chips from Qualcomm and Google in most benchmarks", though the older chip may lead to the iPhone 14 receiving fewer updates, similar to what happened with the iPhone 5C from 2013.[29][30]


Display
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 14 features a 6.1-inch (155 mm) display with Super Retina XDR OLED technology at a resolution of 2532 × 1170 pixels and a pixel density of about 460 PPI with a refresh rate of 60 Hz. The iPhone 14 Plus features a 6.7-inch (170 mm) display with the same technology at a resolution of 2778 × 1284 pixels and a pixel density of around 458 PPI. Both models have typical brightness of up to 800 nits, and a max brightness of up to 1200 nits.[7]


Cameras
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 14 and 14 Plus feature the same camera system with two cameras: one front-facing camera (12MP f/1.9), and two back-facing cameras: a wide (12MP f/1.5) and ultra-wide (12MP f/2.4) camera, with the wide and front-facing cameras having a faster aperture than the iPhone 13. The front-facing camera also has autofocus for the first time.[33]

The cameras use Apple's latest computational photography engine, called Smart HDR 4. Users can also choose from a range of photographic styles during capture, including rich contrast, vibrant, warm, and cool. Apple clarifies this is different from a filter because it works intelligently with the image processing algorithm during capture to apply local adjustments to an image, and the effects will be baked into the photos, unlike filters which can be removed after applying.[7]

The camera app contains Cinematic Mode, which allows users to rack focus between subjects and create (simulate) shallow depth of field using software algorithms. It is supported on wide and front-facing cameras in 4K at 30 fps and 60 fps.[7]

An "Action mode" feature was added to extend the electrical video stabilization. When activated, a smaller crop of the image sensor is read out for video recording. While reducing the field of view, a wider area around it can be used as buffer against shakes. The area read out from the image sensor is moved between frames to counteract hand movements.[34]


Battery
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 14 is equipped with slightly longer battery life compared to the iPhone 13. According to Apple, the iPhone 14 (3,279 mAh) can provide up to 20 hours of video playback,[35] 16 hours of streaming video playback, and 80 hours of audio playback. Its predecessor, the iPhone 13 (3,240 mAh), is rated for up to 19 hours of video playback, 15 hours of streaming video playback, and 75 hours of audio playback. The larger iPhone 14 Plus (4,325 mAh) variant provides up to 26 hours of video playback.[36]


Software
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 14 and 14 Plus originally shipped with iOS 16. The next-generation Qi2 wireless charging standard was added to the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus with the update to iOS 17.2.[37] The latest version of iOS, iOS 18, which was revealed at Apple's WWDC 2024 event, was released to the public on September 16, 2024, and is compatible with the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus.

Satellite connectivity
--------------------------------------------------
Apple's new Emergency SOS via satellite service for iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro models uses the spectrum in L and S bands designated for mobile satellite services by ITU Radio Regulations. When an iPhone user makes an Emergency SOS via satellite request, the message is received by an orbiting satellite operated by Globalstar. The satellite then sends the message down to ground stations located across the globe.[11]

As of November 2022, Globalstar operates a constellation of 25 satellites in low Earth orbit, with plans to enhance this in the future via its partnership with Apple.[11][42]

The service became available to US and Canada on November 15, 2022, and to the UK, Germany, Ireland, and France on December 13, 2022.[43] From May 15, 2023 the service became available in Australia and New Zealand.[44]


Criticism
--------------------------------------------------

Crash Detection false positives
--------------------------------------------------
Crash Detection is a feature built into the iPhone 14 that is designed to detect severe car crashes and automatically initiates an emergency phone call 20 seconds after it is detected unless the user cancels it.[45] Since its release, there have been many reports saying that the feature was automatically turned on during rollercoaster rides, due to the fact that the rides suddenly stop after going at high speeds, acting the same way a car crash does.[46][47]

Emergency dispatchers have received many false alarm calls from iPhone 14 and Apple Watch users who have been skiing safely. In Colorado, a wave of false 9-1-1 calls led Aspen Mountain to advise device owners to upgrade their operating systems or disable the feature.[48] In Japan's Hida Mountains, emergency dispatchers reported 134 false emergency calls, more than 14% of the total emergency call volume, between December 16, 2022, and January 23, 2023, attributed to Crash Detection triggering while an iPhone 14 owner was skiing.[49]


Repairability
--------------------------------------------------
While the iPhone 14 was originally lauded for its innovative new hardware design and recommended by iFixit, concerns over software limitations on parts not authorized by Apple caused iFixit to decrease their evaluation to a 4/10 or "not recommended" in September 2023.[50][51]

List of iPhone models

The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are smartphones developed and marketed by Apple. They are the seventeenth generation of iPhones, succeeding the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus. The devices were announced on September 12, 2023, during the Apple Event at Apple Park in Cupertino, California alongside the higher-priced iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max. Pre-orders began on September 15, 2023, and the devices were made available on September 22, 2023. Like the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, the 15 and 15 Plus are the first iPhones to replace the proprietary Lightning connector with USB-C to comply with European Union mandates.


History
--------------------------------------------------
In September 2021, the European Commission began considering a proposal to mandate USB-C on all devices in the European Union, including iPhones.[10] Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo claimed that Apple would drop its proprietary Lightning connector by 2023. At the time of those claims, Apple was considering switching to USB-C due to the likelihood that the EU proposal would pass.[11] The proposal was passed into law in October 2022, becoming the Radio Equipment Directive. Apple confirmed it would comply with the regulations later that month.[12]

Two weeks prior to the formal introduction of the iPhone 15, it was announced that some of the devices which were made in India would for the first time be sold around the world on the launch day.[13]


Design
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 15 is the first major redesign since the iPhone 12, featuring rounder edges and a slightly curved display, and back glass. Both models are available in five colors: blue, pink, yellow, green and black.[1] This makes it the first entry level iPhone since the iPhone XR to not ship with a Product Red variant at launch.


Hardware
--------------------------------------------------

Display
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 15 features a 6.1-inch (155 mm) display with Super Retina XDR OLED technology at a resolution of 2556×1179 pixels and a pixel density of about 460 PPI with a refresh rate of 60 Hz. The iPhone 15 Plus features a 6.7-inch (170 mm) display with the same technology at a resolution of 2796×1290 pixels and a pixel density of about 460 PPI. Both models have an improved typical brightness of up to 1,000 nits, a peak HDR brightness of up to 1,600 nits, and a peak outdoor brightness of up to 2,000 nits.[9] The Dynamic Island feature, previously exclusive to iPhone 14 Pro, is now standard on iPhone 15, replacing the notch that was introduced in the iPhone X.[14]


Charging and transfer speeds
--------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------
All iPhone 15 models have support for DisplayPort Alternate Mode over USB-C video output with HDR up to 4K resolution.[9]

Previous iPhone models (from iPhone 5 until iPhone 14) had a maximum supported resolution of 1600 x 900 (slightly less than 1080p) with the Lightning Digital AV Adapter due to technical constraints of the Lightning connector.[17]


Battery
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 15 Plus offers users up to 26 hours of video playback and up to 100 hours of audio playback, and the iPhone 15 offers significantly less, with up to 20 hours of video playback and up to 80 hours of audio playback.[18]

Overheating
--------------------------------------------------
Some owners claimed that their iPhone 15s were experiencing overheating issues,[26] reportedly reaching temperatures as high as 47 °C (117 °F).[27] Apple later stated that there were several reasons why the phones heat up, mainly hinting at a software issue.[28] It was stated that it would be fixed with an update to iOS 17.0.3.[29] The overheating issues were reported to persist after the update.[30]

List of iPhone models

The iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus are smartphones developed and marketed by Apple. They are the eighteenth-generation iPhones, succeeding the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus, and those phones succeed the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus. The devices were unveiled alongside the higher-priced iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max during the September 9, 2024 Apple Event at Apple Park in Cupertino, California.[3] These lower-end phones come with the software update iOS 18, with more updates to come later in the future.


History
--------------------------------------------------
When Apple announced in "It's Glowtime" Event, The SiP chip of the lower-priced iPhone 16 lineup have skipped from the Apple A17 Pro (used in the iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max and iPad Mini 7th generation) to the regular Apple A18 (a low-entry variant 5-core GPU successor to the Apple A16 Bionic used in the iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 14 Pro Max, iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus) which this SiP is the first Apple A-series SiP in the iPhone to come with the two variants including the low-entry Apple A18 (a 5-core GPU variant, used in the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus) and the high-end Apple A18 Pro (a 6-core GPU variant, used in the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max).

The devices were unveiled during an event on September 9, 2024, marking the first time an iPhone release had been announced on a Monday.[4] It is also the first iPhone to not come included with Apple stickers, as Apple removed it for "environmental reasons", but the stickers can be included if a customer asks for it at an Apple Store.[5]


Design
--------------------------------------------------
Like the iPhone 15, the device features rounded edges, a slightly curved display, and back glass.


Display
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus retain their screen sizes of 6.1 inches and 6.7 inches, respectively. They feature a full-edge screen design with slim borders.


Camera
--------------------------------------------------
iPhone 16 features a more refined dual-lens array on the back, with a 48 megapixel Fusion wide-angle lens and 12 megapixel ultra-wide lens. The cameras are now aligned vertically, similar to iPhone 12, instead of diagonally like on iPhone 15, enabling spatial video capture.

There is also an improved Photographic Styles feature for real-time lighting and color adjustments, allowing specific tones and colors to be manipulated. [6]


Colors
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 16 and 16 Plus come in five colors: ultramarine, teal, pink, white and black.[7]


Hardware
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 16 and the iPhone 16 Plus use an Apple A18 system on a chip. The chip is optimized for running Generative artificial intelligence and features a Neural Engine that is twice as fast as its predecessor.

The iPhone 16 includes an updated 48-megapixel Fusion camera, the same resolution as the iPhone 15, with 2 μm, quad pixel PDAF, sensor-shift OIS, 100% Focus Pixels, support for super-high-resolution photos (24MP and 48MP). It has a new ultrawide camera with a wider aperture, automatic focus and 1.4 μm, 100% Focus Pixels.[8]

All ‌iPhone 16‌ models have an improved thermal design. The main logic board has been updated, centralizing chip placement and optimizing the surrounding architecture. The recycled aluminum substructure dissipates heat for up to 30 percent higher sustained performance for gaming.[9]

Every model in the iPhone 16 lineup has support for WiFi 7.[10]


Action Button
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus come with the Action Button, first featured on the iPhone 15 Pro lineup. By default, the Action Button toggles silent mode. However, users can change the button's feature to do different things other than silent mode, like open the Camera app or toggle a focus mode.


Camera Control button
--------------------------------------------------
All iPhone 16 models now come with a new button called Camera Control. This button is on the right side of the device, and allows the user to open the camera app, switch between different camera controls and features, and taking photos and videos. The button can distinguish between light and hard presses. By pressing the button once, it opens the camera app. By lightly pressing it twice, it opens a small menu with different camera controls, such as zoom or tone. Pressing the button hard once takes a photo, while holding for a few seconds starts a video. [11]


Battery and charging
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 16 has been upgraded in terms of battery capacity.[12]

The base iPhone 16 has video playback duration of up to 22 hours, while the iPhone 16 Plus has video playback up to 27 hours. The iPhone 16 has duration of audio playback up to 80 hours, 20% less than the iPhone 16 Plus with 100 hours of audio playback. The MagSafe wireless charging standard has been refreshed with a longer cable as an option, allowing the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus to charge at a faster speed of 25W with a 30W power adapter.


Enclosure
--------------------------------------------------
The enclosure is made up of 85% recycled content.[8]


Software
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 16 launched with iOS 18. While the device was announced alongside Apple Intelligence, these features were delayed until after release.[13]

iOS 18 includes RecoveryOS on the iPhone 16 series that allows users to recover and restore firmware wirelessly using another iPhone.[14]


Specifications
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 16 and 16 Plus have a vertical camera layout, similar to the iPhone 12, as opposed to the diagonal layout for iPhone 13, iPhone 14, and iPhone 15. USB Type-C port is used, albeit with USB 2.0 data transfer speeds up to 480 Mb/s.[15]


Price
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 16 has a starting price of US$799, while the iPhone 16 Plus starts at US$899. Pre-orders began on September 13, 2024, and sales started September 20.[16]


Criticism
--------------------------------------------------
The iPhone 16 has received positive feedback for several aspects, but also shows a few limitations. The upgraded design is a favourite, bringing a refreshed aesthetic with the available vibrant colour options, which feel more dynamic than past models. The display maintains Apple’ Super Retina HDR quality, but is limited to a 60Hz refresh rate, which some users find outdated compared to faster displays on cheaper competitor phones.[17][18]
